# Branch Synthesis: Biorecognition probes: aptamers and antibodies for PFAS in FETs\n## Branch ID: 50b8053e38461b66\n## Depth: 3\n\nA. Consolidated Insights (6 bullets)
- Aptamers (SELEX-derived PFOS/PFOA aptamers) are the best-supported biorecognition probes for PFAS detection on PFETs, with concrete binding data for PFOS/PFOA and potential for multiplexed arrays (e.g., PFOS, PFOA, related PFAS). Representative affinities in non-FET contexts show PFOS KD ≈ 6–7 μM and PFHxS/PFOA affinities in the low μM to sub-μM range, illustrating feasible binding that could translate to gate transduction.
- Multiplexed aptamer arrays on gate-immobilized, ultrathin PFETs and transduction schemes leveraging conformational switching or surface-charge modulation are repeatedly highlighted as enabling routes to label-free, gate-proximal PFAS sensing with Debye-length considerations addressed by proximity and materials choice.
- Debye-length mitigation is a central design theme for PFAS-FETs, with emphasis on ultrathin channels, 2D materials, short linkers, and oriented immobilization to ensure binding events near the gate produce detectable electrical signals.
- Antibodies show comparatively weaker evidence for PFAS-FET implementations in the reviewed literature; there is no robust, platform-matched PFET performance data for antibodies, making aptamers the more prudent starting point for PFAS-FET sensor development.
- Quantitative device-level metrics (e.g., LOD, dynamic range) for PFAS-FET aptamer sensors in real waters are largely not reported in the summaries, creating a substantial gap between binding knowledge and field-ready PFET performance.
- Practical design guidance consistently centers on: oriented immobilization of PFAS-binding aptamers, matrix-compatible calibration, and an array-based approach to cover PFOS, PFOA, and related PFAS, with attention to fouling resistance and matrix effects in real waters.

B. Divergent Claims (statement vs. counter-statement)
- Claim: Aptamers are the best-supported PFAS probes for PFET sensing in water.
  - Counter-statement: There is no platform-matched, head-to-head PFET data comparing aptamers to antibodies on identical devices; evidence is largely indirect and device-level metrics are not yet demonstrated.
- Claim: Antibodies offer high specificity for PFAS targets and could be viable PFET probes.
  - Counter-statement: In the PFAS-FET literature surveyed, antibodies have far less supporting evidence; significant challenges (surface orientation, fouling, stability) undermine their current suitability versus aptamers for label-free PFET sensing.
- Claim: Multiplex aptamer arrays enable broad PFAS screening on a single chip.
  - Counter-statement: Real-world, matrix-rich performance data for multiplex PFAS-FET arrays are not demonstrated; cross-reactivity and matrix effects may complicate single-chip broad screening without extensive calibration and standardization.

C. Notable Gaps (3 bullets)
- No device-level PFAS-FET performance metrics (LOD, dynamic range, response time) reported for aptamer-based sensors across real water matrices; quantitative benchmarking is missing.
- No platform-matched, head-to-head PFET comparisons between aptamer and antibody probes on identical devices/surface chemistries; evidence is indirect and lacks direct parity testing.
- Limited data on long-term stability, fouling resistance, cross-lab reproducibility, and standardized fabrication/calibration protocols needed to move PFAS-FET aptamer sensors toward field deployment and regulatory relevance.

D. Confidence
- Confidence: Medium
  - Rationale: There is a coherent, repeatedly stated preference for aptamers and clear design principles (multiplexed aptamer arrays, Debye-length mitigation, oriented immobilization). However, substantial quantitative device-level data, head-to-head comparisons with antibodies, and real-water validation are lacking, so definitive conclusions remain provisional.

E. Notable Candidates
- aptamers, SELEX-derived PFOS/PFOA aptamers, antibodies, graphene-based FETs, CNT-based FETs, ultrathin oxide/2D materials, Debye-length mitigation, conformational switching, gate-coupled transduction, oriented immobilization, ultrathin/2D-channel PFETs, aptamer arrays, multiplexed PFAS sensing
