# Final Research Report: what is the best probe to detect PFAS in water in a FET sensor platform\n\nIntroduction
The research topic asks: what is the best probe to detect PFAS in water when implemented on a field-effect transistor (FET) sensor platform? The synthesis below integrates three complementary perspectives provided in the branch summaries: (1) Biorecognition probes on PFETs, focusing on aptamers vs antibodies and the design of multiplexed, gate-proximal detection with Debye-length considerations; (2) Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and other synthetic receptors on FETs, emphasizing near-gate binding, broad PFAS coverage, array-based approaches for speciation, and real-water performance targets; (3) Computational discovery and supramolecular design for PFAS probes on FETs, highlighting β-cyclodextrin–based MIPs as leading candidates, the role of docking and dielectric modeling, and the translation challenges from non-FET to PFET devices.

The report outlines the synthesized findings across these perspectives, identifies and analyzes contradictions, highlights unique insights from each branch, presents a consolidated conclusion addressing the original question, and provides a candidate inventory to aid decision-making for researchers designing PFAS-FET sensors.

Synthesized Findings
Core convergences across branches

- Aptamers are repeatedly highlighted as a strong, well-supported class of PFAS biorecognition probes for PFETs, with concrete binding data for PFOS/PFOA in non-FET contexts and clear potential for multiplexed gate-proximal sensing. Representative affinities reported in non-FET contexts show PFOS KD around 6–7 μM and PFHxS/PFOA in the low μM to sub-μM range, implying feasible binding that could translate into gate transduction if design constraints (e.g., Debye-length mitigation) are met.
- Debye-length mitigation is consistently treated as a central challenge for PFAS-FETs. Across both aptamer- and MIP-focused lines, the community emphasizes ultrathin channels, 2D materials, short linkers, oriented immobilization, and proximity of the binding event to the gate as essential to converting binding into a measurable gate signal.
- Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are presented as the most mature synthetic-receptor route for PFAS sensing in water within these summaries, with broad PFAS affinity, near-gate binding advantages, and design strategies for either broad screening or targeted speciation via sensor arrays. The two-pronged strategy (broad PFAS-imprinting plus targeted PFOS/GenX gates) is repeatedly proposed to balance coverage with discrimination.
- Real-water validation is a pervasive target across both branches, but concrete device-level PFAS-FET metrics (LOD, dynamic range, response time) are largely missing in the summaries. There is substantive evidence from non-FET platforms (e.g., PFOS/PFOA imprinted MIPs, GenX-imprinted MIPs, β-CD–MIP in non-FET contexts) that could be translated to PFETs with the right deposition/interfacing protocols and matrix handling.
- There is an explicit call for head-to-head, platform-matched comparisons between aptamer- and antibody-based probes on identical PFET devices; however, such device-level comparisons on identical platforms are not reported, leaving a gap between binding affinity data and PFET performance.

Distinct evidence and guidance from each branch

- Biorecognition probes (aptamers vs antibodies): The branch emphasizes aptamers as the best-supported PFAS probes for PFET sensing, given binding data for PFOS/PFOA and the potential for multiplexed arrays near the gate. It stresses oriented immobilization and gate-proximal transduction, but notes that antibody-based PFET data are comparatively sparse and lack robust, platform-level performance metrics on PFETs. The practical design guidance stresses matrix calibration, fouling resistance, and array-based coverage of PFOS, PFOA, and related PFAS, acknowledging that real-water matrices introduce significant variabilities.
- MIPs and synthetic receptors: This perspective argues that MIPs offer a mature, versatile approach for PFAS sensing on FETs, with near-gate binding and a clear strategy for either broad PFAS screening or targeted speciation (PFOS, GenX, etc.). Reported performance targets in real waters include ng/L to sub-ng/L sensitivity in analogous non-FET contexts, and the central Debye-length challenge is highlighted as a critical design constraint. The proposed dual-pathway approach—one gate with broad PFAS imprinting and other gates with targeted PFAS—offers a practical framework. Gaps include lack of device-level regeneration data and the absence of PPE-like standardization across labs for benchmarking.
- Computational and supramolecular design: The computational branch positions β-CD–MIP as the leading probe class in terms of design maturity for PFAS-FETs, supported by docking, binding-energy screening, and dielectric/transduction modeling. Real-water performance data from non-FET β-CD–MIP platforms show ppt–ng/L sensitivity and antifouling features, suggesting strong transduction potential if integrated into a PFET with proper near-gate binding. However, there is no published fully integrated β-CD–MIP PFET demonstrated in real water with complete performance metrics, and there are critical gaps in deposition protocols, regeneration, and matrix effect quantification.

Notable gaps across branches (shared themes)

- Absence of device-level PFAS-FET performance metrics (LOD, dynamic range, response time) for aptamer- or MIP-based PFET sensors in real water. Quantitative benchmarking on real waters is largely missing, hampering regulatory relevance and cross-lab reproducibility.
- Lack of platform-matched, head-to-head PFET comparisons between aptamer- and antibody-based probes on identical devices and surface chemistries.
- Limited data on long-term stability, fouling resistance, regeneration (especially on-device, mild desorption), and standardized fabrication/calibration protocols necessary for field deployment.
- While real-water data from non-FET platforms provide credible performance targets, a rigorous translation to PFET devices requires explicit demonstrations of near-gate binding with minimal Debye screening, robust matrix conditioning, and validated calibration in complex waters (hardness, NOM, chlorination byproducts).

Contradiction Analysis & Resolution
Significant tensions emerge across the integrated perspectives. Key contradictions and how they might be resolved (or why they persist) are:

- Aptamers are the best-supported PFAS probes for PFETs vs. MIPs are the best-projected for PFAS on FETs. The truth likely reflects data availability rather than a fundamental truth about probe efficacy. Aptamers have robust binding data in non-FET contexts and wide literature on conformational switching and gate-proximal transduction, but device-level demonstrations on PFETs and real-water metrics are sparse. Conversely, MIPs have maturation in terms of near-gate binding, broad PFAS affinity, and strong real-water performance targets in non-FET contexts, but PFET demonstrations with real-water metrics are not yet published. The resolution is to view both as complementary: invest in MIP-FET implementations for near-term field-ready potential while pursuing aptamer-based PFET architectures in parallel, with direct, controlled head-to-head testing on identical PFET devices to establish parity or superiority under the same conditions.
- Debye-length mitigation claims vs. absence of device-level demonstrations. All branches emphasize Debye-length constraints as a central challenge; however, fully demonstrated PFET devices that quantify improvements from ultrathin channels or imperfectly screened environments in real water are not yet published. The resolution is to prioritize prototypes that couple ultrathin, gate-proximal binding with real-water conditioning strategies and to require explicit device-level benchmarking of Debye-length mitigation in realistic matrices before committing to any single probe class.
- Real-water performance targets (NG/L to sub-ng/L) from non-FET MIP studies vs. PFET device-level metrics missing. This discrepancy is a gap in translational science rather than a contradiction. The practical path to resolution is to translate those non-FET performance benchmarks into device-level experiments: fabricate ultrathin MIP-FET or β-CD–MIP PFETs, implement near-gate deposition, and perform controlled real-water calibrations across representative PFAS panels to establish LOD/LOQ and dynamic range on devices.

Unique Perspective Insights
- Biorecognition probes perspective: It foregrounds the practical realities of binding chemistry, matrix effects, and transduction mechanics at the gate. The emphasis on aptamers’ demonstrated PFOS/PFOA binding and the potential for multiplexed gate arrays offers a clear path toward broad PFAS screening on a single chip. This branch also highlights the critical need for oriented immobilization and proper calibration strategies to realize label-free, gate-proximal detection in real waters.
- Molecularly imprinted polymers perspective: It emphasizes design versatility (broad vs targeted imprinting), the strong rationale for near-gate binding to maximize signal amid Debye screening, and the strategic value of a two-pathway approach (broad screening plus PFOS/GenX-targeted gates). The perspective stresses real-water performance targets and regeneration as essential for field deployment, and it provides a practical blueprint for multi-gate sensor arrays to cover multiple PFAS families.
- Computational discovery perspective: It provides a rigorous design philosophy grounded in molecular recognition principles, leveraging β-CD–MIP as a leading candidate due to its host–guest chemistry, antifouling tendencies, and compatibility with gate interfaces. The perspective underscores the power of docking and dielectric modeling to tailor film topology and crosslink density, and it connects molecular-level design with device-level transduction. It also identifies the critical translation gap to PFET devices and highlights the need for robust, standardized deposition methods and real-water validation.
- Cross-cutting insight: All branches converge on the necessity of aligning binding events with gate transduction in the presence of Debye screening, and all stress that device-level validation in real water is the defining hurdle to move from promising concepts to field-ready sensors. The mixed emphasis on aptamers vs MIPs suggests a hybrid strategy could be most robust in practice: use MIP-based gating for broad coverage and β-CD–MIP or aptamer-enhanced gates for specificity and selectivity, validated through head-to-head PFET testing.

Comprehensive Conclusion
What is the best probe to detect PFAS in water on a PFET platform? The integrated view from the three perspectives suggests that no single probe can yet be proclaimed definitively superior for all real-world conditions. However, the strongest near-term candidate—given the current evidence landscape and the practical needs of field deployment—appears to be MIP-based PFAS sensing with near-gate, ultrathin films (β-CD–MIP in particular stands out from the computational branch as a leading, design-guided class). The β-CD–MIP route combines mature host–guest recognition, potential antifouling benefits, and proven compatibility with gate-level transduction in related non-FET platforms, along with a clear computational-to-device design loop. Nonetheless, real-world PFET demonstrations with real-water calibration and standardized performance benchmarks remain to be published; two critical development steps are required: (i) device-level PFET demonstrations of PFOS-, GenX-, and broad-PFAS-targeted MIPs (including regeneration protocols and matrix-effect studies) and (ii) direct head-to-head PFET comparisons of aptamer vs MIP probes on identical device architectures under controlled real-water conditions.

In parallel, aptamer-based PFAS probes retain substantial promise, especially for multiplexed gate arrays and conformational-switching strategies, but their PFET performance in real water is not yet substantiated by device-level data in the provided literature. An integrated platform strategy that couples near-gate MIP-based sensing for broad PFAS coverage with complementary aptamer-based or GenX-targeted gates could yield a robust, multiplexed PFAS-FET platform that balances coverage, specificity, and transduction efficiency, pending direct device-level validation.

Notes on tables and data interpretation
- The table reflects the current state of evidence in the provided summaries. Where device-level PFET metrics are absent, the table notes non-FET performance or the lack of published device data.
- The numbers cited (e.g., PFOS KD values, real-water LODs for β-CD–MIP non-FET platforms) come from the consolidated insights in the branch summaries. Where exact PFET device-level numbers are not provided, the entries are marked as not published (n/a) in order to keep the comparison honest.

Overall, the integrated assessment suggests a practical, near-term path to robust PFAS-FET sensing lies with MIP-based approaches, particularly near-gate MIP films, complemented by focused aptamer-based or GenX-targeted gates to achieve multiplexed discrimination. The β-CD–MIP route stands out as a mature, design-guided candidate with strong translational potential, provided that device-level PFET demonstrations in real water are published and standardized. The ultimate “best” probe will likely emerge from a deliberate combination—MIP-based broad screening with targeted, high-specificity gates (β-CD–MIP, aptamer-based gates, or GenX-imprinted MIPs), implemented on an architecture that minimizes Debye-length limitations through ultra-short binding distances and ultrathin channel designs, and validated by cross-laboratory real-water benchmarking.
