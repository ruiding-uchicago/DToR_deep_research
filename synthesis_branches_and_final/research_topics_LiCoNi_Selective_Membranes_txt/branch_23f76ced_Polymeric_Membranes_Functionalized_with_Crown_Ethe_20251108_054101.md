# Branch Synthesis: Polymeric Membranes Functionalized with Crown Ethers and Charged Moieties for Tunable Electrostatic Selectivity\n## Branch ID: 23f76ceda31d1ebe\n## Depth: 3\n\n**A. Consolidated Insights (≈ 6 bullets)**  

- **Dual‑gate selectivity:** Combining size‑matched crown‑ether cavities (12‑, 15‑, 18‑crown‑4/5/6) with a permanent charge (quaternary‑ammonium, sulfonate, or polymer‑bound anion) consistently yields Li⁺ (or Co²⁺/Ni²⁺) separation factors of **30–60×** in binary tests and **> 30×** in multicomponent feeds when the charge density is ≥ 1 mmol g⁻¹.  
- **High uptake & flux:** Li⁺ uptake spans **27–297 mg g⁻¹** (depending on polymer platform) while water permeance of crown‑ether‑filled nanofilms reaches **30–40 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹**; electrodialysis cells deliver **22.6 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹** Li⁺ flux with a Li⁺/Mg²⁺ separation factor ≈ 872.  
- **Alkaline durability:** Crown‑ether grafts on AEMs retain **≥ 85 %** OH⁻ conductivity after **1200 h** in 1 M KOH (80 °C) and show **≤ 10 %** Li⁺ capacity loss after five 0.5 M HCl regeneration cycles. Covalent cross‑linking or nanofiller reinforcement limits tensile loss to **< 5 %** after **200 h** continuous operation.  
- **Fouling‑mitigation via bias:** Cathodic or AC‑EMBR bias (‑4 to ‑8 V) provides **99.8–100 %** flux‑recovery rates against silica, CaCO₃, humic acid and BSA; TMP growth is halved (0.017 bar d⁻¹ vs 0.034 bar d⁻¹) compared with DC operation.  
- **Scalable fabrication:** Layer‑by‑layer (LbL) deposition of alternating PEI/12‑crown‑4 on porous supports achieves **≤ 5 µm** total thickness in a roll‑to‑roll pilot (0.5 m min⁻¹) with performance comparable to lab‑scale membranes (selectivity > 40, uptake ≈ 100 mg g⁻¹).  
- **Modeling gap:** No quantitative relationship presently links fixed‑charge density (mmol g⁻¹) to an effective crown‑ether binding constant (K_eff); existing studies treat electrostatic and size effects separately, limiting predictive design for multicomponent brines.

**B. Divergent Claims (statement ↔ counter‑statement)**  

- **Claim:** “Crown‑ether functionalisation alone can achieve Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity > 10⁴ in binary mixtures.”  
  **Counter‑statement:** Experimental data show the highest binary Li⁺/Na⁺ factor is **≈ 60**; ultra‑high selectivity (> 10⁴) is only reported for crystal‑channel membranes under idealised conditions, not for polymeric films.  

- **Claim:** “Fixed‑charge density above 1 mmol g⁻¹ guarantees > 90 % Li⁺ capacity retention after any number of acid regenerations.”  
  **Counter‑statement:** Long‑term leaching of crown‑ether ligands (> 50 cycles) has not been quantified; reported retention is limited to **5 × 0.5 M HCl cycles**, leaving uncertainty for > 10 cycles.  

- **Claim:** “Electrodialysis with crown‑ether AEMs can be operated continuously without fouling.”  
  **Counter‑statement:** While bias‑enhanced fouling control shows > 99 % flux recovery, real‑world seawater tests report **TMP growth** and require periodic AC‑EMBR or chemical cleaning, indicating fouling is still a concern.  

- **Claim:** “The dual‑gate architecture eliminates the need for any post‑treatment or cleaning.”  
  **Counter‑statement:** Pilot‑scale RO/ED runs (LG BW 400 R G2) required **≥ 15** cleaning cycles over 15 months, demonstrating that routine regeneration remains necessary.

**C. Notable Gaps (≈ 3 bullets)**  

- **Full brine mapping:** No systematic study of Li⁺/Co²⁺/Ni²⁺ (or Li⁺/Na⁺/Mg²⁺/Ca²⁺) selectivity across the entire pH (3–10) and ionic‑strength (0.1–5 M) range of real seawater or battery leachates.  
- **Quantitative K_eff model:** Absence of a validated equation linking charge density (σ) to an effective crown‑ether binding constant (K_eff), preventing predictive scaling of selectivity and uptake.  
- **Long‑term leaching & lifecycle cost:** Crown‑ether loss after > 50 regeneration cycles (wt % loss) has never been measured, hindering accurate lifecycle‑cost and environmental impact assessments.

**D. Confidence**  
**High** – the synthesis draws on multiple, consistent quantitative data points across four research iterations and aligns with reported experimental metrics.
