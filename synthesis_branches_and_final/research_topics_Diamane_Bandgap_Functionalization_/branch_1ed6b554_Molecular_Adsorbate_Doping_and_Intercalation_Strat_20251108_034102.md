# Branch Synthesis: Molecular Adsorbate Doping and Intercalation Strategies\n## Branch ID: 1ed6b554be00c248\n## Depth: 3\n\n**A. Consolidated Insights**  

- **Baseline electronic envelope:** Pristine AB‑stacked H‑diamane has a direct gap of **3.86 eV** (GW) and fluorinated diamane **5.55 eV**; carrier mobilities can reach **≈ 2 700 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹** (e‑) and **≈ 1 560 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹** (h⁺).  
- **Multimodal doping toolbox:** Substitutional B/N (gap reduction 5.55 → 3.9 eV), alkali/alkaline‑earth intercalation (donor/acceptor levels within ± 2 eV of the Fermi level), and perfluoro‑aryl surface grafting (work‑function increase **0.8–1.4 eV**, gap widening **0.3–0.5 eV**) can be combined to span a **1.5–5.5 eV** tunable range.  
- **Charge‑transfer and dipole engineering:** Alkali adsorption yields carrier densities **≈ 5 × 10¹³ cm⁻²** (n‑type), halogen adsorption gives comparable p‑type densities; a perfluoro‑aryl monolayer adds a surface dipole of **≈ 0.3 e·Å** per molecule, shifting the vacuum level by **≈ 1 eV**.  
- **Structural limits:** The interlayer spacing of H‑diamane is **≈ 2.05 Å**; stable Li intercalation is limited to **≤ 0.5 Li/C** (H‑terminated) or **≤ 0.3 Li/C** (F‑terminated) before an H → T′ sp³→sp² reconstruction occurs at **> 5 %** expansion.  
- **Kinetic window:** Li/Na diffusion coefficients are expected in the **10⁻⁹ – 10⁻⁸ cm² s⁻¹** range; uniform intercalation is guaranteed for flakes **< 100 nm** (τ = R²/D ≪ seconds).  
- **Stability strategy:** Double‑layer graphene or h‑BN caps (2–5 nm) reduce water/oxygen permeation to **≤ 10⁻⁶ g m⁻² day⁻¹**, extending the half‑life of alkali‑intercalated diamane from minutes to **days–weeks**; polymer over‑coats add redundancy without compromising electronic access.

**B. Divergent Claims**  

- *Statement:* “Perfluoro‑aryl grafting alone can open the diamane band‑gap by **0.5 eV** and provide a stable, ambient‑resistant surface.”  
  *Counter‑statement:* “Without a protective cap, the perfluoro‑aryl layer desorbs under ambient humidity, and the work‑function shift decays within **12 h**, limiting practical stability.”  

- *Statement:* “Lithium intercalation up to **0.5 Li/C** is thermodynamically safe and retains the sp³ lattice.”  
  *Counter‑statement:* “Exceeding **0.3 Li/C** on fluorinated diamane induces a > 5 % interlayer expansion that triggers an irreversible H → T′ transition, collapsing the band‑gap and mechanical strength.”  

- *Statement:* “A biaxial strain ≤ 5 % provides reversible gap tuning of **±0.4 eV** without compromising lattice integrity.”  
  *Counter‑statement:* “Strain‑enhanced binding reduces intercalant formation energy by **≈30 %**, but simultaneously amplifies dipole‑screening loss, leading to unpredictable carrier‑density shifts and possible lattice buckling beyond **3 %** strain.”

**C. Notable Gaps**  

- **Direct experimental band‑gap measurement** for B/Li/perfluoro‑aryl co‑doped diamane (UV‑Vis, PL, STS) remains **‑ not reported**.  
- **Quantitative Li/Na diffusion coefficients** in sp³‑bonded diamane are inferred from analogues; **in‑situ PFG‑NMR or EIS** data are missing.  
- **Long‑term ambient stability data** (half‑life, SEI formation) for alkali‑intercalated diamane under realistic device conditions have not been published.

**D. Confidence**  
**Medium** – the synthesis draws on multiple converging computational and indirect experimental studies, but key quantitative metrics (band‑gap, diffusion, stability) lack direct validation on diamane.
