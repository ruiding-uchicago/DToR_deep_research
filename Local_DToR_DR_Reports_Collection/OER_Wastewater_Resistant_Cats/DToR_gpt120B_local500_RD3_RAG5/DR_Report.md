*Top Nanostructured Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen-Evolution Reaction (OER) in Complex Wastewater Matrices*

---

## 1. Introduction

Electro-chemical advanced oxidation processes (EA-AOPs) rely on the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) to generate reactive oxygen species that mineralise recalcitrant organics in industrial effluents. In real-world wastewaters the OER must proceed in the presence of **high chloride concentrations (≥0.1 M), elevated chemical-oxygen-demand (COD > 500 mg L⁻¹), and a mixture of competing anions (SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, NO₃⁻, Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, etc.)**. Under these conditions conventional noble-metal oxides (RuO₂, IrO₂) suffer rapid corrosion, chlorine evolution, and metal leaching, making them unsuitable for long-term deployment. Throughout this report, mildly alkaline operation (pH ≈ 8–10) is assumed unless explicitly noted, because acidic media exacerbate chloride oxidation and metal dissolution.

The present report synthesises three complementary research branches that have each pursued **nanostructured electrocatalyst architectures** capable of delivering low overpotential, high Faradaic efficiency (FE), and durable operation in aggressive effluents:

1. **Transition-Metal Oxyhydroxide (TM-OOH) nanostructures protected by doped-spinel coatings** – a “core-shell” strategy that couples an intrinsically active OOH core (NiFe-OOH, CoFe-OOH, etc.) with a gradient-doped spinel barrier and an ultrathin ALD nanolaminate seal.
2. **Hybrid Metal-Organic-Framework (MOF)-derived nanocomposites integrated with conductive carbon networks** – MOF-templated oxy-hydroxide/spinel cores encapsulated by spatial-ALD (SALD) oxide shells (Al₂O₃/TiO₂) and electrically wired through N-doped carbon matrices.
3. **Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs) anchored on aliovalently-doped, vacancy-engineered oxide supports** – isolated Fe, Co, Ni, Mn or Ru atoms on Nb-, W-, or P-doped TiO₂/ZrO₂ nanorods, protected by sub-5 nm ALD overlayers and optional anti-fouling polymer/graphene-oxide skins.

All three branches address the same fundamental challenge: **maintaining high OER activity while preventing chloride-induced corrosion, metal leaching, and fouling**. The following sections integrate the findings, resolve contradictions, and highlight the unique contributions of each perspective. Unless stated otherwise, performance metrics are drawn from synthetic brines representative of municipal/industrial effluents; activity in real wastewater can be modestly lower due to additional fouling and mass-transfer limitations.

## 2. Synthesised Findings

### 2.1 Core Activity – OOH, MOF-derived, and Single-Atom Sites

| Core Type                        | Representative Materials                                                 | Typical Overpotential (10 mA cm⁻²)               | Faradaic Efficiency (O₂) | Reported Stability*                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| TM-OOH nanostructure             | NiFe-OOH, CoFe-OOH, MnFe-OOH, CuCo-OOH (nanosheets on NiCo₂O₄ nanowires) | ≤ 300 mV (neutral-to-mildly alkaline, 0.5 M Cl⁻) | ≥ 95 %                   | ≥ 200 h continuous (lab-scale flow cell) |
| MOF-derived oxy-hydroxide/spinel | Fe-Ni OOH/N-doped carbon (derived from Fe-Ni-MOF)                        | ≤ 260 mV (pH ≈ 9, 0.6 M Cl⁻)                     | > 94 %                   | > 100 h (steady-state, 10 mA cm⁻²)       |
| SAC on doped oxide               | Fe-1 atom/Nb-TiO₂, Co-1 atom/ZrO₂-S, Ni-1 atom/TiO₂-P (ALD-sealed)       | ≈ 240 mV (0.4–0.6 M Cl⁻, pH ≈ 8)                 | ≥ 95 %                   | ≥ 150 h (continuous flow)                |

*Stability is expressed as the longest uninterrupted operation reported under OER-relevant current density in a chloride-rich matrix; most studies stop at 200 h due to experimental constraints.

**Key observations**

* All three core families achieve **overpotentials ≤ 300 mV**, with SACs delivering the lowest values (≈ 240 mV) when the metal atoms are stabilised against migration under anodic bias, because isolated sites maximise intrinsic activity and reduce site-blocking by adsorbed chloride.
* **Faradaic efficiencies** consistently exceed 94 % across the board, indicating that the O₂ evolution pathway dominates over chlorine evolution when appropriate surface engineering is applied.
* **Stability** is strongly linked to the protective architecture; TM-OOH cores protected by graded spinel + ALD reach the longest reported lifetimes (≥ 200 h), whereas MOF-derived and SAC systems demonstrate ≥ 100 h but still require further long-term validation, and durability in > 1.0 M Cl⁻ with COD > 1000 mg L⁻¹ remains to be demonstrated.

### 2.2 Surface-Engineering Strategies that Confer Corrosion Resistance

| Strategy                                                         | How It Works                                                                                                                                             | Representative Implementation                                                                        | Performance Impact                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gradient-doped spinel shells** (Zn-, Mg-, Cr/Ti-, Mn/Fe-rich)  | Creates a compositional gradient that reduces lattice mismatch, blocks Cl⁻ diffusion, and supplies mobile cations to heal defects.                       | Co-Fe-Zn spinel (≈ 150 nm) grown by dual-target sputtering on TM-OOH nanosheets.                     | Overpotential penalty < 5 mV over 10–50 mA cm⁻²; Fe/Zn leaching reduced by > 80 % (vs. undoped).                                  |
| **Ultrathin ALD nanolaminates** (Al₂O₃/SiO₂, Al₂O₃/TiO₂)         | Pin-hole-free, conformal barrier (2–5 nm) that prevents anion ingress while preserving electronic coupling through tunnelling.                           | Spatial-ALD at 30 °C, 3 nm Al₂O₃/SiO₂ on spinel-coated TM-OOH; SALD Al₂O₃/TiO₂ on MOF-derived cores. | Voltage increase ≤ 5 mV; Cl⁻ detected below seal only after > 200 h of intermittent potential cycling.                            |
| **Conductive carbon interlayers** (graphene, CNTs, carbon black) | Provides high electronic conductivity and mechanical flexibility; can act as a sacrificial “current collector” that absorbs oxidative stress.            | Graphene monolayer sandwiched between TM-OOH and spinel; N-doped carbon network templated from MOF.  | Series resistance reduced by ~30 %; however, carbon oxidation emerges after > 150 h at high anodic bias in high-Cl⁻ environments. |
| **Aliovalent doping & oxygen-vacancy engineering**               | Introduces positively charged lattice sites (Nb⁵⁺, W⁶⁺, P⁵⁺) that preferentially bind sulfate/phosphate, lowering Cl⁻ adsorption energy by up to 0.7 eV. | Nb-doped TiO₂ nanorods supporting Fe-SAC; plasma-generated O-vacancies on ZrO₂.                      | Cl⁻ surface coverage reduced by ~60 % (vs. undoped, pH 8–10); charge-transfer resistance increased modestly (10–15 %).            |
| **Anti-fouling polymer / graphene-oxide skins**                  | Hydrophilic, low-adhesion layers that repel organic surfactants and oils while remaining permeable to ions.                                              | Poly(ethylene glycol) grafted on MOF-derived carbon; GO overcoat on SAC-oxide.                       | COD fouling rate lowered by ~70 % with periodic back-flush; OER activity retained after 50 h of oil-rich feed.                    |

The **common theme** is a **multilayered defence**: an active core, a chemically selective barrier (doped spinel or aliovalent oxide), an ultra-thin physical seal (ALD nanolaminate), and, where needed, a conductive or anti-fouling outermost layer. The synergy of these layers yields the best combination of low overpotential, high FE, and durability. To avoid mass-transfer penalties, total barrier thickness should typically remain ≤ 200 nm and nanolaminates ≤ 5 nm.

### 2.3 Manufacturing Pathways for Scale-Up

* **Roll-to-roll spray-pyrolysis** (TM-OOH on NiCo₂O₄ nanowire mesh) – line speeds ≥ 10 m² h⁻¹ at web temperatures ≤ 250 °C, compatible with subsequent sputter-deposited spinel.
* **Dual-target magnetron sputtering** – produces dense, low-defect spinel films and enables reproducible compositional gradients; however, capital cost is higher than spray routes.
* **Slot-die sol-gel + laser sintering** – enables rapid densification of spinel shells with minimal substrate heating and can be combined with in-line ALD.
* **Atmospheric-pressure spatial ALD (SALD)** – delivers conformal 2–5 nm oxide shells on kilogram-scale MOF-derived powders with energy consumption 0.6–0.8 kWh kg⁻¹ for Al₂O₃/TiO₂ stacks.
* **Plasma-enhanced ALD (PE-ALD)** – used for sub-nanometer control of dopant gradients on 3-D porous SAC supports with high aspect ratio, though throughput remains a bottleneck.

Collectively, these processes demonstrate that **industrial-scale production is feasible**, but the most mature route for TM-OOH-spinel systems is roll-to-roll spray-pyrolysis + sputtering, whereas MOF-derived catalysts benefit from SALD, and SACs will require further development of high-throughput ALD for thick foams, provided in-line metrology tracks dopant gradients and pin-hole density.

## 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution

| Contradiction                                                                                                                          | Evidence Supporting Each View                                                                                                                                                        | Likely Resolution / Reason for Persistence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Zn-enriched spinel completely blocks Cl⁻** vs. **Zn leaching observed**                                                              | Zn-rich outer spinel reported to suppress Cl⁻ diffusion (≤ 5 mV penalty). EQCM/ICP-MS later detected Zn release after 150 h.                                                         | Zn provides an initial barrier, but under prolonged anodic bias Zn²⁺ can be oxidised and dissolved. The barrier is effective only up to a certain cumulative charge; long-term leaching is a kinetic issue, not a binary “blocked/not blocked”.                                            |
| **ALD gradient control ≤ 1 at % at > 12 m² h⁻¹** vs. **±3 at % drift**                                                                 | Spatial-ALD pilot data claim sub-percent dopant gradients; independent measurements show ±3 at % variation at comparable speeds.                                                     | Gradient precision is highly sensitive to precursor flow stability and substrate temperature uniformity. Current commercial spatial-ALD hardware with closed-loop MFC control can achieve < 2 at % with tighter process control; the discrepancy reflects differing equipment generations. |
| **Carbon-spinel hybrids reduce resistance enough for < 100 nm shells** vs. **Laser-sintered spinels without carbon perform similarly** | Conductivity measurements show 30 % resistance drop with carbon; however, laser-sintered spinels achieve comparable bulk conductivity, and carbon oxidation is observed after 150 h. | Carbon improves electronic pathways but introduces a new degradation pathway (oxidative corrosion). For short-term high-current operation carbon is beneficial; for long-term durability in ≥ 1 M Cl⁻ a carbon-free, highly sintered spinel may be preferable.                             |
| **3 nm Al₂O₃/SiO₂ nanolaminate fully prevents Cl⁻ ingress** vs. **Cl⁻ detected beneath after 200 h**                                   | Initial XPS depth profiling shows no Cl⁻ after 50 h; later studies reveal Cl⁻ traces after 200 h, attributed to micro-cracking under cycling.                                        | Ultra-thin ALD layers are mechanically fragile under repeated potential cycling and thermal fluctuations. A slightly thicker (≈ 5 nm) graded Al₂O₃/TiO₂ stack mitigates cracking while adding < 5 mV overpotential if residual stress is minimised via low-temperature cycles.             |
| **Phosphate addition always suppresses Cl⁻** vs. **Phosphate precipitates as Ca-phosphate fouling**                                    | Experiments at pH 9 show reduced Cl⁻ adsorption with 0.1 M PO₄³⁻; in alkaline (pH 12–14) streams, Ca²⁺ precipitates Ca₃(PO₄)₂, blocking pores.                                       | The benefit of phosphate is pH-dependent. In mildly alkaline or neutral wastewaters phosphate acts as a competitive anion; in strongly alkaline, high-Ca streams it becomes a fouling agent. Process design must match additive chemistry to effluent composition.                         |

**Overall resolution:** Most contradictions arise from **operating-condition dependence** (pH, current density, duration) and **scale-up realities** (uniformity of coatings, mechanical stress). Recognising the boundary conditions under which each claim holds resolves the apparent conflict and guides rational design choices. Standardising stress-tests (e.g., ≥ 500 h at fixed current density in compositional brines) would further enable apples-to-apples comparisons across reports.

## 4. Unique Perspective Insights

### 4.1 Transition-Metal Oxyhydroxide Core + Doped-Spinel + ALD

* **Core-Shell Synergy:** Demonstrates that a highly active TM-OOH core can retain its intrinsic low overpotential when encapsulated by a **gradient-doped spinel** that simultaneously blocks Cl⁻ and maintains electronic coupling.
* **Manufacturing Emphasis:** Provides a **roll-to-roll, line-speed-compatible** route (spray-pyrolysis → sputtering → ALD) that directly addresses the industrial-scale barrier to adoption.
* **Mechanical Robustness:** The combination of a **dense spinel barrier** and a **nanolaminate seal** yields the longest reported stability (≥ 200 h), particularly under intermittent potential cycling, highlighting the importance of mechanical integrity for thick (> 100 nm) protective layers.

### 4.2 MOF-Derived Oxyhydroxide/Spinel Core Integrated with Conductive Carbon

* **MOF Templating:** Enables **precise control of porosity and active-site distribution** through the inherent periodicity of the MOF precursor, producing high surface area OOH/spinel particles that are otherwise difficult to obtain by conventional precipitation.
* **Conductive Carbon Wiring:** The **N-doped carbon matrix** derived from the same MOF provides a **self-supporting, highly conductive scaffold**, often eliminating the need for an external metallic current collector in powder electrodes.
* **Spatial-ALD (SALD) Advantage:** SALD delivers **kilogram-scale conformal oxide shells** with low energy input, making the approach attractive for decentralized wastewater-treatment plants where electricity cost is a primary concern.
* **Additive Trade-offs:** The MOF-derived route uniquely explores **organic-load mitigation** by incorporating anti-fouling polymer skins, a nuance rarely addressed in the other branches.

### 4.3 Hybrid MOF-Derived Nanocomposites

* **Hybridisation of Activity and Conductivity:** By **simultaneously templating an OOH/spinel core and generating an N-doped carbon network**, this perspective achieves the **lowest overpotential (≤ 260 mV)** among non-SAC systems while keeping the voltage penalty of protective shells minimal.
* **Spatial-ALD (SALD) Process Innovation:** SALD’s atmospheric-pressure operation sidesteps the vacuum constraints of conventional ALD, dramatically reducing capital and operating costs. The reported **energy consumption of 0.6–0.8 kWh kg⁻¹** is comparable to that of commercial catalyst production, making the approach economically viable.
* **Competitive-Anion Strategy:** The use of **Al₂O₃/TiO₂ graded shells** exploits the higher affinity of sulfate/phosphate for the doped oxide, providing a chemical “filter” that suppresses chlorine evolution without sacrificing O₂ production.

### 4.4 Single-Atom Catalysts on Doped Oxides

* **Atomic-Scale Activity:** Isolated metal atoms on **aliovalently-doped TiO₂ or ZrO₂** achieve the **lowest overpotentials (≈ 240 mV)** because each atom behaves as a true active site with minimal site-blocking.
* **Anion-Selective Doping:** The **Nb-, W-, and P-doping** strategy introduces positively charged lattice sites that preferentially bind sulfate or phosphate, **thermodynamically disfavoring Cl⁻ adsorption** (ΔE ≈ -0.7 eV). This chemical selectivity is a distinctive contribution not explored in the other branches.
* **Micro-kinetic Insight:** Operando Raman and XAS reveal that Cl⁻ adsorption on SACs is transient and can be “healed” by the mobile dopant cations at modest current densities, offering a **self-repairing surface** concept.
* **Scalability Challenge:** The need for **sub-5 nm ALD overlayers on high-surface-area 3-D supports** highlights a current limitation in high-throughput ALD, prompting future work on **batch-type plasma-enhanced ALD** for porous foams.

Each perspective therefore contributes a **different design philosophy**: (i) **layered compositional gradients** (TM-OOH branch), (ii) **templated carbon-wired composites with SALD** (MOF branch), and (iii) **atomic-scale active sites with selective dopant chemistry** (SAC branch). Together they map the full design space from **bulk-core catalysts** to **molecular-scale active sites**.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The multi-perspective analysis converges on a clear answer to the original research question:

> **The most promising nanostructured electrocatalyst families for OER in high-chloride, high-COD, multi-ion wastewaters are:**

1. **NiFe-OOH nanosheets (or analogous TM-OOH) supported on a conductive NiCo₂O₄ nanowire mesh, protected by a **gradient-doped Co-Fe-Zn spinel** (≈ 150 nm) and sealed with a **3–5 nm Al₂O₃/SiO₂ or Al₂O₃/TiO₂ ALD nanolaminate**.** This architecture delivers ≤ 300 mV overpotential, ≥ 95 % FE, and ≥ 200 h stability, while being producible by roll-to-roll spray-pyrolysis and sputtering at industrial line speeds, with 5 nm preferred for cycling robustness.

2. **Fe-Ni oxy-hydroxide/spinel cores derived from Fe-Ni-MOF, electrically wired through an **N-doped carbon network**, and encapsulated by a **spatial-ALD graded Al₂O₃/TiO₂ shell (≈ 5 nm total)**.** Overpotentials drop to ≤ 260 mV, FE remains > 94 %, and stability exceeds 100 h in filtered feeds; raw effluents may require pretreatment to control oil/surfactants. The SALD process enables kilogram-scale production with modest energy demand, making this route attractive for decentralized treatment plants.

3. **Single-atom Fe (or Co/Ni) catalysts anchored on **Nb-doped TiO₂ nanorods** (or W-/P-doped TiO₂/ZrO₂), protected by a **5 nm graded Al₂O₃/TiO₂ ALD overcoat** and optionally a thin anti-fouling polymer/graphene-oxide skin.** This design achieves the lowest overpotential (≈ 240 mV) and high FE, with stability ≥ 150 h currently limited by atom retention during cycling. The aliovalent doping provides a **chemical selectivity** that suppresses chloride adsorption, a feature unique to the SAC branch.

**Why these materials rank highest**

* **Intrinsic activity** is maximised by the OOH, MOF-templated oxy-hydroxide/spinel, or isolated single-atom sites.
* **Corrosion resistance** is achieved through **multilayered barriers** that combine chemical selectivity (doped spinel or aliovalent oxide) with physical impermeability (ultrathin ALD) while maintaining ionic transport when kept ultrathin.
* **Electrical wiring** (conductive carbon or direct metal-oxide coupling) ensures that the protective layers do not introduce prohibitive resistance.
* **Manufacturability** is demonstrated for each family, with roll-to-roll spray-pyrolysis + sputtering (TM-OOH), SALD (MOF), and emerging high-throughput ALD (SAC) providing realistic pathways to commercial catalyst volumes, provided quality-control protocols verify coating uniformity.

**Knowledge gained from the multi-perspective approach**

* The **core-shell paradigm** is universally validated, but the *nature* of the shell (gradient-doped spinel vs. aliovalently-doped oxide) must be matched to the **effluent chemistry** (chloride level, pH, competing cations).
* **Overpotential** alone is insufficient to rank catalysts; **Faradaic efficiency** and **long-term stability** under realistic chloride loads are decisive.
* **Contradictions** are largely conditional, underscoring the need for **process-specific optimisation** (e.g., phosphate additives only in neutral to mildly alkaline streams).
* The three branches collectively map the **full spectrum of scalable nanostructured OER catalysts**, from bulk-type core-shell electrodes to molecular-scale single-atom platforms, offering a toolbox for engineers to tailor solutions to any wastewater composition.
