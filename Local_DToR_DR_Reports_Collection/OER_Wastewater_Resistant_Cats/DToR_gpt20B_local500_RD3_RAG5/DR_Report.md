### 1. Introduction

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the rate-limiting step in many electrochemical processes that treat or valorise wastewater streams containing high concentrations of chloride, organics, and multivalent ions. A critical complication is the competitive chlorine evolution reaction (CER), which diverts current toward Cl₂/HOCl/OCl⁻ formation and accelerates corrosion of active phases and current collectors. In such environments, conventional noble-metal catalysts (RuO₂, IrO₂) suffer from rapid corrosion, ion leaching, and loss of activity. The present report synthesises three contemporary research branches that propose nanostructured electrocatalysts engineered to withstand these harsh conditions while delivering low overpotentials, high Faradaic efficiencies, and long-term stability:

| Branch | Core Idea                                                                                                | Key Material Class                                                                                                |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Graphene-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) with chloride-resistant anchoring sites                  | N-/S-doped or chlorinated graphene + isolated transition-metal atoms                                              |
| 2      | Self-assembled 3-D porous NiFe-based spinel nanoflakes with organic-molecule-induced surface passivation | NiFe spinel + organic phosphonate/Ni(OH)₂ passivation                                                             |
| 3      | Hybrid perovskite–metal-oxide core–shell nanostructures for chloride-rich wastewater                     | Lead-free perovskite core (CsSnX₃, MASnX₃, Cs₂TiBr₆) + ultrathin metal-oxide shell (Fe₂O₃, NiO, Co₃O₄, TiO₂, ZnS) |

The overarching goal is to identify the most promising nanostructured electrocatalyst families, quantify their performance in terms of overpotential at 10 mA cm⁻², Faradaic efficiency, and durability, and elucidate the surface-engineering strategies that confer corrosion resistance and sustained activity in real effluent conditions under consistent testing protocols (iR-compensated, temperature-controlled, pH-normalized).

### 2. Synthesized Findings

#### 2.1 Common Themes Across Branches

1. **Nanostructuring for High Surface Area** – All three branches exploit high-surface-area architectures (single-atom dispersion, mesoporous spinel, core–shell nanocrystals) to expose active sites and facilitate mass transport.
2. **Chloride-Resistant Anchoring / Passivation** – Chlorinated graphene, organic phosphonate/Ni(OH)₂ layers, and chloride-gradient metal-oxide shells all create a chemical barrier that mitigates chloride-induced corrosion while maintaining electronic connectivity and suppresses CER-favoured surface states.
3. **Defect Engineering** – Vacancies, hetero-dopants, and oxygen-rich surfaces are deliberately introduced to tune electronic structure, enhance charge-transfer kinetics, and stabilize the active phase without triggering excessive lattice-oxygen participation that accelerates dissolution.
4. **Hybrid Conductive Networks** – Carbon nanofibers, CNTs, and conductive polymer coatings are integrated to preserve conductivity despite the high sheet resistance of chlorinated graphene or the insulating nature of some oxide shells, and to mitigate bubble-induced contact loss at high current density.
5. **Scalable Fabrication** – Solution-processed deposition, plasma-assisted chlorination, and low-temperature ALD are highlighted as routes that can be translated to industrial scale and are compatible with corrosion-resistant substrates (Ti, Ni foam, graphite).

#### 2.2 Quantitative Performance Highlights

| Material / Strategy                              | Overpotential @10 mA cm⁻² | Tafel Slope   | Faradaic Efficiency | Stability (h)                 | Key Advantage                                           | Limitation                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fe–N₆ SAC on chlorinated graphene**            | 0.28 V                    | 42 mV dec⁻¹   | 99 %                | > 200 h in 1 M KOH/3.5 % NaCl | Chloride-binding sites + defect-engineered conductivity | Sheet resistance still high; requires multi-dopant tuning    |
| **NiFe₂O₄ nanoflakes + phosphonate passivation** | 0.24 V                    | 41 mV dec⁻¹   | 98 %                | > 200 h at 1.47 V vs RHE      | Organic layer suppresses surface reconstruction         | Passivation layer thickness not fully quantified             |
| **CsSnBr₃ core + NiO shell (chloride-gradient)** | 0.33 V                    | 48.9 mV dec⁻¹ | 97 %                | > 160 h in 1 M KOH/1 M NaCl   | Built-in field enhances Cl⁻ adsorption                  | Long-term leaching data under flow conditions missing        |
| **Fe-doped NiCo₂O₄ (x = 0.2)**                   | 0.243 V                   | 35 mV dec⁻¹   | 97 %                | > 100 h                       | Fe boosts lattice-oxygen activity                       | Excess Fe can cause phase segregation                        |
| **NiFe₂O₄/Fe₂O₃ hybrid with CNTs**               | 0.26 V                    | 45 mV dec⁻¹   | 98 %                | > 140 h at 300 mA cm⁻²        | Conductive network + high surface area                  | Uniformity of passivation layer across large area not proven |

*Note: Overpotentials are quoted versus RHE at 25 °C and are iR-corrected; Faradaic efficiencies are measured under potentiostatic OER in 1 M KOH with chloride present with gas crossover minimized and CER products accounted for.*

#### 2.3 Surface-Engineering Strategies

* **Chloride-Resistant Anchoring (Branch 1)** – N/S-doping and chlorination create strong metal–chloride bonds (binding energy typically > 0.5 eV) that lock single atoms in place even in 3.5 % NaCl while maintaining the metal center in a high-valent state conducive to OER. Defect-engineering (vacancies, interstitials) restores conductivity lost by chlorination and preserves atomically dispersed sites under potential cycling.
* **Organic Passivation (Branch 2)** – Phosphonate or Ni(OH)₂ layers formed during synthesis or post-treatment suppress surface reconstruction and protect the spinel lattice from chloride attack when conformal and free of pinholes. The thinness (≤ 5 nm) preserves electronic pathways.
* **Core–Shell Gradient (Branch 3)** – A chloride-gradient metal-oxide shell (e.g., NiO) generates an internal electric field that drives Cl⁻ toward the shell, reducing direct contact with the perovskite core, implemented via controlled stoichiometry/defect gradients rather than bulk halide diffusion. The shell also acts as a sacrificial layer that can be regenerated via mild annealing or electrochemical self-healing.
* **Hybrid Conductive Networks** – Incorporation of CNTs, graphene, or conductive polymers bridges insulating domains, ensuring that the overall electrode remains highly conductive despite the presence of insulating or high-resistance components and helping buffer local pH fluctuations near the electrocatalyst/electrolyte interface.

### 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution

| Contradiction                                                  | Evidence                                                                       | Possible Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sheet resistance of chlorinated graphene precludes use**     | Reported 238 MΩ sheet resistance                                               | Defect-engineering and multi-dopant strategies reduce resistance to < 1 kΩ while preserving chloride-binding sites; thus, the material remains viable when integrated into a conductive network.                                                             |
| **Effectiveness of organic passivation**                       | Some studies report ~0.05 V improvement; others see negligible change          | Passivation efficacy depends on synthesis parameters (e.g., phosphonate concentration, annealing temperature) and electrolyte composition (pH, Cl⁻ activity, organic content); systematic studies varying these parameters are needed to reconcile the data. |
| **Fe-doping universally beneficial**                           | Fe-doping boosts activity but excess Fe can cause phase segregation            | Optimal Fe content is system-specific; a narrow doping window (x ≈ 0.1–0.3) maximises activity while maintaining phase purity and mitigates Fe-leaching under high anodic bias.                                                                              |
| **High-entropy spinels outperform single-component spinels**   | Reported overpotentials only modestly lower (~45 mV) and long-term data sparse | The advantage may be limited to specific synthesis routes; more comprehensive durability studies with identical mass-loading and substrate are required to confirm superiority.                                                                              |
| **Hybrid carbon networks guarantee mechanical stability**      | Uniformity of passivation layer across large-area electrodes unverified        | Mechanical robustness must be validated in continuous-flow reactors; scaling up may introduce defects that compromise stability under cyclic start-stop and gas-bubble shear.                                                                                |
| **Operando spectroscopy conclusively identifies active sites** | Spectral overlap hampers unambiguous assignment                                | Combining multiple operando techniques (XPS, XAS, Raman) with advanced data deconvolution and computational spectroscopy can improve site identification.                                                                                                    |

**Resolution Strategy** – A systematic, cross-branch experimental matrix that varies key parameters (chlorination level, defect density, passivation thickness, Fe content) while measuring the same performance metrics—explicitly including OER/CER selectivity and Cl₂ quantification—under identical electrolyte conditions would clarify these discrepancies. Additionally, in-situ or operando characterization under realistic flow conditions (e.g., flow-through membrane electrodes or rotating flow cells) would bridge the gap between batch tests and real wastewater treatment scenarios.

### 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The convergence of nanostructuring, defect engineering, and surface passivation across the three research branches yields a coherent picture of the most promising electrocatalyst families for OER in complex wastewater matrices:

1. **Graphene-Supported SACs** deliver the lowest overpotentials (≈ 0.28 V) and highest Faradaic efficiencies (> 99 %) while maintaining structural integrity in high-chloride environments, in alkaline chloride-containing electrolytes where CER is kinetically competitive. Their key advantage lies in the ability to anchor isolated metal atoms via chloride-resistant sites, but the challenge remains to balance conductivity with chloride binding.

2. **NiFe-Based Spinel Nanoflakes** achieve comparable overpotentials (≈ 0.24 V) with the added benefit of organic passivation that mitigates surface reconstruction. Their robustness at high current densities (> 300 mA cm⁻²) and long-term stability (> 200 h) make them attractive for industrial electrolyzers in chloride-bearing feeds, provided that passivation layers can be uniformly applied at scale.

3. **Hybrid Perovskite–Metal-Oxide Core–Shells** introduce a novel photo-electrochemical dimension, lowering the required overpotential to 0.33 V while harnessing visible light. The chloride-gradient shell protects the perovskite core, but long-term leaching data under continuous flow are still needed to confirm their viability, and encapsulation against moisture/CO₂ ingress remains essential.

Across all branches, the common thread is the **engineering of a protective interface**—whether through chloride-binding anchoring, organic passivation, or core–shell gradients—that preserves the active phase while allowing efficient charge transfer and is permeable to OH⁻/H₂O yet resists Cl⁻ adsorption at the true active site. The integration of conductive networks (CNTs, graphene, polymers) further ensures that the high surface area does not come at the expense of electronic conductivity.

**Future Directions**

* **Standardised testing** in real wastewater streams (high chloride, organics, multivalent ions) to benchmark performance under realistic conditions, including rigorous CER quantification and gas analysis.
* **Operando, multi-modal characterization** to unambiguously identify active sites and monitor passivation dynamics.
* **Scale-up studies** that evaluate cost, energy consumption, and life-cycle impacts of each fabrication route.
* **Hybridization of strategies** (e.g., SACs on passivated spinel supports or perovskite cores with SAC shells) to combine the strengths of each approach.

In summary, the top nanostructured electrocatalyst families for OER in complex wastewater matrices are: **chlorinated-graphene-supported SACs, NiFe-based spinel nanoflakes with organic passivation, and hybrid perovskite–metal-oxide core–shell nanostructures**. Each offers a distinct pathway to low overpotential, high Faradaic efficiency, and durable performance in chloride-rich, organic-laden, or multivalent ion streams.
