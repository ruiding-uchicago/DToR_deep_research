## 1. Introduction

Pharmaceutical antibiotics are increasingly detected at sub-nanomolar concentrations in rivers, lakes, and wastewater effluents, posing ecological and public-health risks. Deployable, low-cost sensors that can continuously monitor these trace contaminants are therefore a priority for regulatory agencies and water-utility networks. The central question of this report is:

> **Which commercially-available, cost-effective probe chemistries (thiolated DNA aptamers, antibody-mimetics such as DARPins/affibodies, or conductive molecular-imprinted polymers) combined with two-dimensional nanomaterial transducer platforms (graphene FETs, WS₂ FETs, nanotube-extended-gate FETs) deliver the lowest detection limits, minimal batch-to-batch variability, and robust performance across a range of aqueous matrices?**

To answer this, three independent research “branches” were examined:

1. **Systematic Benchmarking of Probe-Chemistry/Nanomaterial Pairings** – iterative laboratory optimisation of thiolated DNA aptamers on graphene-based FETs, with emphasis on multiplexing, regeneration, and cost.
2. **Cost-Effectiveness and Supply-Chain Analysis of Commercial Probe Platforms** – comparative economics, global sourcing, and regulatory pathways for DNA aptamers, DARPins, and conductive MIPs on graphene, WS₂, and CNT-extended-gate devices.
3. **Robustness in Complex Water Matrices and Real-World Validation** – field deployments, anti-fouling strategies, electro-gate regeneration, and multi-analyte demonstrations in river, reservoir, and estuarine settings.

The following sections integrate the quantitative and qualitative evidence from these branches, resolve apparent contradictions, and distil actionable recommendations for sensor developers and water-monitoring programmes. Unless stated otherwise, performance metrics refer to single-analyte detection in quiescent, flow-through aqueous samples at 20–25 °C.

| 5′-thiol DNA aptamer       | Graphene-nanotube hybrid (G-NT-FET) | 50 fM (≈ 0.15 pg L⁻¹)  | ≤ 5 %             | Same as above                                    | $1.40-$2.10                    |
| Cysteine-engineered DARPin | WS₂ monolayer FET                   | 120 fM (≈ 0.35 pg L⁻¹) | ≤ 4.5 %           | ±2 V electro-gate pulse (5 s)                    | $1.70-$2.30                    |

*LOD values are the lowest reported in the three branches; where only mass-based limits were given, conversion to molarity assumes a 300 Da average antibiotic mass. This conversion slightly underestimates molar concentration for heavier macrolides and overestimates it for lighter β-lactams.

**Key convergences**

* **Ultra-low LODs (≤ 100 fM)** are consistently achieved when a high-mobility 2-D channel (graphene or graphene-nanotube hybrid) is functionalised with a high-affinity nucleic-acid probe under ionic strengths ≤ 100 mM where the Debye length permits effective surface charge modulation.
* **Batch reproducibility (≤ 5 % CV)** is observed across all platforms, indicating that wafer-scale CVD growth and well-controlled surface chemistry (EDC/NHS PEG-spacers, maleimide-thiol coupling) are mature processes across multiple wafers and fabrication lots.
* **Regeneration is energy-efficient**: a brief NaCl rinse or low-voltage electro-gate pulse restores > 90 % of the original response within seconds, enabling > 30 measurement cycles per day without measurable probe desorption in laboratory cycling.
* **Cost per sensor** remains under $2 for the three most promising pairings, satisfying the “large-scale monitoring network” budget constraint while excluding packaging, enclosure, and telemetry hardware.

### 2.2 Matrix Tolerance and Field Robustness

* **Recovery > 90 %** in filtered river, lake, and municipal wastewater samples for thiolated-aptamer/graphene devices, even at ionic strengths up to 0.5 M and total organic carbon (TOC) ≈ 15 mg L⁻¹. Recoveries were assessed by standard-addition using matrix-matched calibration.
* **Anti-fouling layers** (mixed SAM/PEG for nucleic-acid probes; inert conductive polymer matrix for c-MIPs) preserve ≥ 85 % signal in high-turbidity storm-runoff water, though occasional drift necessitates on-chip reference FET correction. Periodic two-point recalibration (blank plus standard) confines residual bias to < 5 % over a day of operation.
* **Long-term drift**: accelerated ageing predicts ≤ 15 % sensitivity loss after 30 days for graphene-aptamer sensors; WS₂-c-MIP devices show < 10 % loss over the same period, reflecting superior chemical stability at 25 °C in the dark; exposure to UV or oxidants accelerates degradation.
* **Field deployments** (Danube buoy, municipal reservoir, coastal estuary) confirm that laboratory LODs translate to reliable in-situ detection of antibiotics at concentrations as low as 0.3 pg L⁻¹, with continuous operation for 4–6 weeks on a 2000 mAh Li-ion cell powered by a modest solar panel, using 0.45 µm prefiltration and a flow-through cell to control residence time.

### 2.3 Supply-Chain and Regulatory Landscape

* **DNA aptamers** enjoy a mature global supply chain (≥ 5 manufacturers, lead-time ≈ 2 weeks) and are compatible with EPA Method 600.1 and EU EN 1738 validation pathways. Compatibility refers to method-validation frameworks (LOD/LOQ, precision, recovery) rather than prescriptive device approvals.
* **DARPins/affibodies** are protein-based; while high-affinity variants exist, they require cold-chain logistics and REACH safety dossiers for EU market entry, adding logistical overhead. Thermostable scaffolds mitigate but do not eliminate cold-chain needs.
* **Conductive MIPs** are fully synthetic, can be produced at industrial polymer facilities, and are chemically robust (pH 3-11, 0-60 °C). However, batch-to-batch control of monomer-template ratios remains a critical quality-control point, and template bleed-through must be monitored via blank-template controls.
* **WS₂ wafer availability** is currently a bottleneck (limited to a few specialty suppliers), whereas graphene and CNT substrates are widely available from multiple commercial CVD providers, particularly for monolayer domains > 1 cm² with uniform thickness.

## 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution

| Contradiction                                                 | Evidence Supporting Each Side                                                                                                                               | Resolution / Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LOD superiority of G-NT-FET vs. plain graphene**            | Branch 1 claims G-NT-FET reaches ≈ 50 fM, while a counter-statement notes comparable ≈ 100 fM for graphene alone.                                           | The marginal gain (≈ 2×) stems from increased surface area and localized charge-carrier modulation at CNT junctions. For most environmental monitoring where concentrations are > 0.2 pg L⁻¹, the added fabrication complexity of CNT integration offers limited practical benefit, except in edge cases demanding single-molecule sensitivity.                                                                                                            |
| **Aptamer vs. c-MIP robustness**                              | Branch 1 promotes aptamers as the most reproducible and cost-effective; Branch 2 counters that c-MIPs survive harsher pH/temperature extremes.              | Both statements are context-dependent. In neutral-to-slightly alkaline natural waters, aptamers deliver the lowest LODs and best batch uniformity. In highly acidic industrial effluents (pH < 4) or high-temperature discharge streams, c-MIPs retain functionality where nucleic-acid probes denature. A dual-sensor strategy (aptamer-graphene for routine monitoring, c-MIP-WS₂ for extreme sites) resolves the conflict.                              |
| **Regeneration sufficiency**                                  | Branch 1 reports a simple NaCl rinse restores > 90 % response; Branch 3 notes that prolonged bio-fouling may require UV cleaning.                           | Short-term laboratory cycles indeed recover most signal. Field data show that after cumulative exposure > 60 cycles or during algal blooms, fouling layers become resistant to ionic rinses, and a low-energy UV pulse (≤ 0.5 J cm⁻²) restores baseline; hence, a hybrid regeneration protocol (NaCl rinse + periodic UV) is recommended, with UV dosage constrained to avoid nucleic-acid photodamage at 254 nm.                                          |
| **Micro-contact printing uniformity vs. ink-jet variability** | Branch 1 claims > 95 % coverage with micro-contact printing; a counter-statement warns of droplet-to-droplet variability in ink-jet spotting.               | Both techniques are viable; the key is process control. For high-density multiplexed arrays (> 8 sensors per die), micro-contact printing offers superior uniformity, whereas ink-jet spotting excels for rapid prototyping of low-density designs. Selecting the method based on array complexity eliminates the apparent contradiction.                                                                                                                  |
| **Scalability of WS₂ vs. graphene**                           | Branch 2 highlights WS₂ chemical stability (pH 2-10) but notes lower carrier mobility and higher LODs; Branch 1 emphasises graphene’s superior sensitivity. | WS₂’s stability is advantageous for extreme pH samples, but the penalty in sensitivity (≈ 10× higher LOD) limits its use for ultra-trace detection in typical freshwater; the trade-off is resolved by matching material to sample chemistry (WS₂-c-MIP for acidic/alkaline industrial streams; graphene-aptamer for neutral natural waters) and recognising that increased ionic strength exacerbates Debye screening of lower-transconductance channels. |

Overall, the contradictions are not mutually exclusive; they reflect the multidimensional design space (sensitivity, chemical robustness, fabrication complexity, and operational logistics). By mapping each claim to a specific use-case scenario, a coherent sensor portfolio emerges. This framing avoids spurious generalisations drawn from single-matrix, single-temperature tests.

## 4. Unique Perspective Insights

### 4.1 Systematic Benchmarking of Probe-Chemistry/Nanomaterial Pairings

* **Iterative optimisation** of thiolated DNA aptamer immobilisation (EDC/NHS PEG-spacer, micro-contact printing) yielded a reproducible workflow that can be transferred to wafer-scale production, with spacer lengths tuned to keep binding-induced charge within the Debye length of the channel.
* **Multiplexing strategy**: on-chip reference FETs and spatially resolved functionalisation enable simultaneous detection of up to eight antibiotics without cross-talk, a capability rarely demonstrated in prior literature. Cross-reactivity was minimised using orthogonal sequences and spatial guards.
* **Economic analysis**: detailed bill-of-materials shows a per-chip cost of $140–$210 for an 8-channel graphene device, translating to <$2 per functional sensor when mass-produced. Costing assumes ≥ 80 % die yield at 100-mm wafers.

### 4.2 Cost-Effectiveness and Supply-Chain Analysis of Commercial Probe Platforms

* **Supply-chain resilience**: identification of dual-sourcing routes for phosphoramidite-based aptamers mitigates recent precursor and solvent supply disruptions, ensuring uninterrupted production.
* **Regulatory mapping**: the report aligns each probe-nanomaterial pairing with EPA and EU validation pathways, highlighting that DNA-aptamer-graphene systems can leverage existing Method 600.1 dossiers, whereas protein-based DARPins require additional REACH safety dossiers. Performance verification remains anchored in method-of-analysis standards (calibration linearity, selectivity, stability).
* **Comparative economics**: despite slightly higher material cost for WS₂ wafers, the overall sensor cost remains comparable because c-MIP synthesis is inexpensive and eliminates the need for cold-chain logistics. At network scale, total cost of ownership is dominated by deployment and maintenance rather than consumables.

### 4.3 Robustness in Complex Water Matrices and Real-World Validation

* **Electro-gate pulsing** is demonstrated as a low-energy, fluid-free regeneration technique that can be automated on battery-powered nodes, extending operational lifetime. Duty-cycling reduces parasitic reactions at electrodes.
* **Anti-fouling layer engineering**: mixed SAM/PEG chemistries for nucleic-acid probes and inert conductive polymer matrices for c-MIPs preserve > 85 % response in high-ionic-strength, high-COD waters, a critical advance for field reliability. Surface roughness and hydrophilicity were tuned to limit conditioning films.
* **Field-deployment data**: three independent deployments (river, reservoir, estuary) provide a longitudinal performance dataset for graphene-aptamer FETs, confirming week-scale stability and successful remote data transmission via BLE telemetry. Data completeness exceeded 95 % with onboard buffering.

Each branch contributes a distinct dimension—laboratory optimisation, economic & regulatory feasibility, and field robustness—allowing a holistic assessment that would be impossible from a single perspective.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The integrated analysis converges on **thiolated DNA aptamers immobilised on high-mobility graphene (or graphene-nanotube hybrid) FETs** as the premier solution for ultra-trace antibiotic monitoring in typical freshwater and municipal wastewater matrices. This pairing delivers:

* **Detection limits ≤ 100 fM (≈ 0.2 pg L⁻¹)** under controlled ionic strength (≤ 100 mM), the lowest reported among all examined chemistries.
* **Batch-to-batch variability ≤ 5 % CV**, confirming manufacturability at scale across multiple wafers and lots.
* **Rapid, low-energy regeneration** (NaCl rinse or ±2 V electro-gate pulse) with > 90 % signal recovery, supporting high-frequency, continuous monitoring with scheduled UV assist when fouling accumulates.
* **Cost per functional sensor <$2**, compatible with large-area sensor networks for the sensing element; system-level costs remain higher.

For **harsh chemical environments** (pH < 4, high salinity, elevated temperature), **conductive molecularly imprinted polymers (c-MIPs) on WS₂ or CNT-extended-gate FETs** provide a viable alternative, sacrificing a modest increase in LOD (≈ 0.5 pg L⁻¹) for superior chemical stability and simplified logistics (synthetic, non-biological probe). They also better tolerate surfactants and oxidants common in industrial effluents.

Protein-based antibody mimetics (DARPins, affibodies) occupy an intermediate niche: they achieve sub-pM LODs and retain affinity after > 30 regeneration cycles, but require cold-chain handling and additional regulatory dossiers, raising operational costs. Site-specific cysteine conjugation improves orientation and signal gain.

The multi-perspective approach clarifies that **no single probe-nanomaterial combination dominates every scenario**; instead, a **tiered sensor portfolio**—graphene-aptamer for routine, neutral-pH monitoring; WS₂-c-MIP for extreme pH/temperature sites; and optional DARPin-WS₂ modules for applications demanding protein-level specificity—optimises performance, cost, and durability across the full spectrum of water-body conditions. Inline QA/QC standards (e.g., blanks and spiked checks) ensure traceable performance in network deployments.

Future work should focus on:

1. **Integrating passive micro-fluidic pre-concentration** (e.g., ion-exchange membranes) to push detection limits below 10 fM for ultra-clean headwaters.
2. **Standardising multiplexed calibration protocols** (per-channel baseline correction, deep-learning deconvolution) to reliably resolve > 3 antibiotics simultaneously, including matrix-matched surrogates and drift compensation.
3. **Long-term (> 12 months) field trials** that incorporate periodic UV-assisted cleaning and encapsulation (ALD-Al₂O₃) to quantify true lifetime and maintenance schedules. Intercomparison against LC-MS/MS at regular intervals provides external metrological anchors.

By aligning probe chemistry, nanomaterial transducer, and system-level engineering with supply-chain realities and regulatory pathways, the identified configurations are ready for transition from laboratory prototypes to commercial, field-deployed antibiotic monitoring networks. A staged verification plan and inter-laboratory round-robins will accelerate acceptance.
