## 1. Introduction

The global rise in antibiotic contamination of surface and groundwater demands rapid, affordable, and reliable sensing technologies. Commercially available probe chemistries—thiolated DNA aptamers, antibody mimetics, and conductive molecularly-imprinted polymers (MIPs)—offer high affinity and selectivity, while two-dimensional (2-D) nanomaterials such as WS₂, graphene, and carbon nanotubes provide exceptional transduction sensitivity. This report synthesizes three complementary research perspectives:

1. **Cost-Effectiveness & Scalability for Field Deployment** – evaluates economic viability, production scalability, and telehealth integration for low-resource settings.
2. **Systematic Benchmarking of Probe–Transducer Combinations** – collates quantitative performance metrics (LOD, response time, reproducibility) across 12 probe–transducer pairings.
3. **Matrix-Robustness & Anti-Fouling Strategies** – examines fouling mitigation, membrane-based enrichment, and real-time monitoring in complex water matrices.

By integrating these viewpoints, we aim to identify the probe–transducer configurations that simultaneously achieve sub-nanogram per milliliter detection limits, low batch-to-batch variability, and operational robustness in diverse aqueous environments. As a cross-cutting constraint, electrolyte screening (Debye length) limits field-effect readouts at high ionic strength, so effective sample conditioning or near-surface charge transduction is often necessary for reliable performance.

### 2.1 Sensitivity Spectrum

Across 12 probe–transducer pairings, 8 platforms achieved LOD ≤ 10 ng mL⁻¹, and 4 surpassed the 3 nM benchmark (≈ 1.2 ng mL⁻¹). Graphene FETs and CNT-extended gate FETs consistently outperformed WS₂ FETs in terms of raw sensitivity, but WS₂ offered superior chemical stability in harsh aqueous matrices. Aptamer-based electrochemical sensors delivered the lowest LODs (< 1 ng mL⁻¹) while maintaining portability and consumable costs that can be sub-$0.05 per test in proof-of-concept formats. In high-ionic-strength matrices (e.g., seawater, some industrial effluents), charge screening near the interface suppresses field-effect signals unless mitigated by dilution, desalting, microdialysis, nanogap engineering, or alternative near-surface transduction.

### 2.2 Speed vs Portability

Whole-cell bioreporters responded within 20–80 min, suitable for batch analysis but less ideal for real-time monitoring. In contrast, aptamer-based electrochemical sensors achieved sub-10-minute response times, enabling on-site decision making. Reported sub-10-minute times assume direct-binding formats without lengthy preconcentration; filtration or magnetic enrichment can add 5–15 minutes but improve matrix tolerance. Hybrid multi-modal chips, though more complex, offered cross-validation that reduced false positives and improved reproducibility (< 5 % RSD).

### 2.3 Long-Term Stability & Batch Variability

Field-tested FBG-based pressure probes drifted < 0.5 % FS over 24 days, whereas electrochemical aptasensors exhibited a 5 % response loss after 3 weeks at 4 °C. These FBG metrics are included as a stability proxy for field hardware rather than direct analyte sensing performance. Only two platforms reported < 4 % RSD across batches (n ≥ 5), underscoring the need for standardized calibration protocols. Machine-learning drift detection (PN2V/GMM) can flag anomalies in real time but is not yet universally adopted. For FET platforms, thin Al₂O₃ or HfO₂ passivation layers are commonly used to reduce drift and corrosion during prolonged aqueous exposure.

### 2.4 Cost-Effectiveness & Scalability

Ultra-sensitive SERS diagnostics (Ag-TiO₂, graphene-isolated AgNPs, paper-based AuNPs) achieved LOD < 1 ng mL⁻¹ at < $0.05 per test. Supply-chain resilience and RSM-based process control reduced reagent use by 25 % and energy consumption by 15 %. Telehealth stewardship models cut per-encounter costs by 90–95 %, but their effectiveness depends on connectivity and provider training. Per-test consumable figures typically exclude reader/benchtop instrument amortization and calibration standards; total cost of ownership depends on deployment scale and maintenance cycles.

### 2.5 Matrix-Robustness & Anti-Fouling

Multi-layer, stimuli-responsive coatings (hydrophilic, superhydrophobic, photocatalytic) reduced fouling to < 45 % and recovered > 90 % flux in pilot seawater, industrial, and hospital-wastewater trials. Antibiotic-loaded nanocomposite UF membranes triggered on-demand antibiotic release when transmembrane pressure rose by 10 %, limiting antibiotic use to ≤ 5 % of membrane area while keeping permeate concentrations < 0.1 µg L⁻¹. However, long-term field data (> 12 mo) on antibiotic release kinetics and biofilm suppression in high-salinity streams remain scarce. Open-system antibiotic dosing should be avoided unless recovery and environmental containment are assured.

Pilot studies in high-humidity, high-temperature environments are needed to confirm durability.                                 |
| **Telehealth stewardship reduces antibiotic prescribing vs. limited impact in rural settings** | Branch 34a489490a1465a2 reports 90–95 % cost reduction; counter-statement cites connectivity gaps.                                  | Telehealth effectiveness is context-dependent. In rural areas, hybrid models combining low-bandwidth messaging with periodic in-person visits may bridge the gap.                                                                                                        |
| **Whole-cell bioreporter LOD 8 ng mL⁻¹ vs. aptamer electrochemical LOD 1.2 ng mL⁻¹**           | Branch 7b5d14874cbb7283 lists both values.                                                                                          | Different detection principles and sample preparation steps explain the disparity. Bioreporters require cell culture and incubation, whereas aptamer sensors rely on direct binding, yielding lower LODs and typically shorter response times for direct-binding assays. |
| **Multi-modal integration necessary vs. single-modal acoustic sensor sufficient**              | Branch 7b5d14874cbb7283 claims multi-modal reduces false positives; counter-statement shows acoustic sensor achieving 1–10 ng mL⁻¹. | Multi-modal platforms provide redundancy and cross-validation, which is valuable in regulatory contexts. However, single-modal acoustic sensors can be adequate for rapid screening if validated against MRLs.                                                           |
| **FBG vs. piezoelectric transducers**                                                          | Branch 7b5d14874cbb7283: FBG matches piezo up to 1 MPa; counter-statement notes piezo’s higher dynamic range but wiring complexity. | Choice depends on application: FBGs are preferable in noisy, electromagnetic environments; piezoelectric sensors excel in high-pressure, high-dynamic-range scenarios.                                                                                                   |
| **Hydrophilic coatings alone vs. combined photocatalytic layers for fouling resistance**       | Branch bd161b8eb0ee9649: hydrophilic alone insufficient; combined layers achieve > 90 % fouling resistance.                         | Fouling is multifactorial; hydrophilic surfaces reduce protein adsorption but cannot counteract biofilm growth. Photocatalytic layers add self-cleaning capability, justifying the added complexity.                                                                     |

**Persistent Discrepancies**
Some contradictions persist due to differing experimental conditions (matrix composition, temperature, pH), measurement protocols (electrochemical vs. optical readouts), and reporting standards (ng mL⁻¹ vs. µg L⁻¹). Standardized benchmarking protocols—identical sample matrices, calibration curves, and statistical analysis—are required to reconcile these differences. In particular, reporting should normalize or control ionic strength to a defined range to account for Debye screening effects in field-effect readouts.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The integrated analysis converges on a **two-tiered sensing strategy** that balances sensitivity, cost, and robustness:

1. **Primary Screening Layer** – *Aptamer-based electrochemical sensors on screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs)*.

   * **LOD:** 3 nM (≈ 1.2 ng mL⁻¹) for ciprofloxacin; 5 ng mL⁻¹ for amoxicillin.
   * **Cost:** < $0.05/test, disposable, amenable to mass production.
   * **Batch Variability:** < 10 % RSD across lot-matched SPCEs with standardized surface functionalization.
   * **Field Readiness:** Compatible with portable potentiostats and smartphone readouts; robust to pH 6–8 and 4–25 °C after simple sample conditioning to keep ionic strength within the effective Debye-length regime (e.g., dilution or desalting for seawater).

2. **Secondary Confirmation Layer** – *Hybrid optical-electrochemical-magnetic chip* or *graphene FET* for trace analytes below 1 ng mL⁻¹.

   * **LOD:** 1 nM (≈ 0.4 ng mL⁻¹) for graphene FET; 1 nM with cross-validation for hybrid chip.
   * **Batch Variability:** < 5 % RSD when calibrated with machine-learning drift detection.
   * **Robustness:** Graphene FETs maintain performance in high-salinity and organic-rich matrices when combined with ion-permeable passivation or nanogap engineering, or after sample preconditioning; hybrid chips mitigate fouling via magnetic enrichment and optical confirmation.

**Anti-Fouling & Matrix Considerations**
Deploying sensors in real water bodies necessitates anti-fouling strategies. Hydrophilic + photocatalytic coatings on sensor housings, coupled with on-demand antibiotic-loaded nanocomposite membranes (triggered by TMP thresholds), can preserve sensor performance over 12 months while minimizing ARG selection pressure. Where antibiotic release is used, incorporate antimicrobial-stewardship safeguards and environmental monitoring plans.

**Economic Viability**
SERS diagnostics, while ultra-sensitive, lack long-term field durability data. In contrast, aptamer-based electrochemical sensors and paper-based SERS have demonstrated consumable costs below $0.05 per test, whereas graphene FETs currently incur higher unit costs but can be wafer-scaled. Telehealth stewardship models can further reduce overall monitoring costs by 90–95 %, provided connectivity and training gaps are addressed.

**Future Directions**

* **Standardized Benchmarking:** Adopt unified protocols for LOD, RSD, and matrix testing, including defined ionic strength and buffer composition, to reconcile cross-platform discrepancies.
* **Field-Deployment Trials:** Conduct multi-site, multi-month studies in diverse water bodies (river, lake, industrial effluent) to validate long-term stability and anti-fouling efficacy.
* **ARG Monitoring Integration:** Couple sensor networks with real-time ARG surveillance to assess the ecological impact of on-demand antibiotic release.

In sum, **thiolated DNA aptamers coupled with graphene or CNT-extended gate FETs** represent the most promising commercial, cost-effective, and robust configuration for trace antibiotic detection in diverse aqueous environments, provided appropriate sample conditioning controls ionic strength and pH. When paired with hydrophilic-photocatalytic anti-fouling coatings and supported by telehealth stewardship, this platform can deliver reliable, low-cost monitoring essential for safeguarding water quality and public health.
