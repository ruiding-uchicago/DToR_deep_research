## 1. Introduction

Plastic pollution has entered the nanometre regime, where particles ≤ 1 µm (nanoplastics) and 1–100 µm (microplastics) become invisible to conventional optical microscopy yet pose serious ecological and health risks. Reliable on-site monitoring demands sensors that combine **ultra-high sensitivity**, **robust selectivity** against dissolved organic matter (DOM) and high ionic strength, and **sub-second response times**. In practice, performance scales with particle size, surface charge density, and salinity via the Debye screening length; unless otherwise noted, metrics refer to particles ≥ 50 nm with |ζ| ≥ 10 mV.

Three complementary research branches have recently converged on this challenge:

| Branch                                                  | Core Platform                                                                       | Recognition Element                                             | Transduction Mode                                                      |

| **A** – Hybrid MXene-Aptamer DEP-FET                    | Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene channel (solution-gated)                                              | DNA aptamers (2′-O-Me / phosphorothioate)                       | Field-Effect Transistor with dielectrophoretic (DEP) pre-concentration |
| **B** – Photonic-Crystal-Enhanced MoS₂-MIP              | MoS₂ monolayer embedded in high-Q photonic crystal (PC)                             | Molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) ± secondary aptamer/peptide | Optical resonance (label-free) ± optional electrical read-out          |
| **C** – Peptide-Functionalized Graphene-Quantum-Dot EIS | Few-layer graphene + graphene quantum dots (GQD) on interdigitated electrodes (IDE) | Short amphipathic peptides (2 nm) with dynamic covalent linkers | Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) with IoT edge processing  |

The present report synthesises the findings from these branches, evaluates contradictions, extracts unique contributions, and delivers a consolidated answer to the original research question: **Which 2-D material platforms, molecular recognizers, and device strategies currently provide the best combination of sensitivity, selectivity, and speed for plastic particle detection in realistic water samples?**

## 2. Synthesized Findings

### 2.1 Common Themes Across All Branches

| Theme                                                | Evidence from Branch A                                                                                                             | Evidence from Branch B                                                                                                              | Evidence from Branch C                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomic-scale conductance or optical confinement**  | MXene’s metallic-level sheet resistance (≈ 10 Ω sq⁻¹) yields > 90 % gate coupling, enabling single-particle charge detection.      | MoS₂ monolayer in a PC provides Q-factors ≥ 5 000, amplifying refractive-index shifts caused by a single nanoplastic.               | Graphene-GQD hybrid offers high carrier mobility (≈ 15 000 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹) and quantum-dot induced capacitance, translating minute binding events into > 10³ % impedance change.               |
| **Molecular-level affinity**                         | Aptamers with K\_D ≈ 0.2 nM, > 100-fold selectivity vs. natural organic matter (NOM) and > 1 000-fold vs. common ions (Na⁺, Ca²⁺). | MIP imprint factor ≈ 8, further boosted to ≈ 30 when combined with a secondary aptamer/peptide.                                     | Peptides display K\_D ≈ 0.5 nM across PE, PP, PS, PET, PVC, with binding kinetics t₁/₂ < 0.5 s.                                                                                             |
| **Pre-concentration or signal-enhancement strategy** | DEP electrodes (10-20 V, 1 MHz) concentrate particles from 1 L to the active channel in < 1 s, lowering LOD to 10² particles L⁻¹.  | PC evanescent-field confinement multiplies effective interaction length by ≈ 10×, achieving LOD ≈ 0.2 µg L⁻¹ (≈ 10³ particles L⁻¹). | Zwitterionic brushes (PMPC) suppress fouling, allowing continuous monitoring; dynamic covalent linkers enable on-chip regeneration within 60–120 s, supporting > 10 000 measurement cycles. |
| **Scalable, low-cost fabrication**                   | Ink-jet/slot-die/gravure printing of MXene inks; per-chip cost ≈ \$0.05, device-to-device variation ≤ 5 %.                         | PC patterning via nano-imprint lithography (NIL) compatible with roll-to-roll; per-sensor cost ≈ \$0.30.                            | Roll-to-roll CVD graphene transfer with in-line GQD grafting; projected cost ≈ \$0.12 per IDE chip.                                                                                         |
| **Robustness in high-ionic-strength water**          | MXene channels retain > 80 % of baseline conductance in 0.6 M NaCl; aptamer performance unchanged after 30 days seawater exposure. | MIP layers are chemically inert; PC resonance shift remains linear up to 0.8 M NaCl when Al₂O₃ passivation is applied.              | Zwitterionic brushes reduce non-specific adsorption by > 95 % in 3.5 % salinity; impedance baseline drift < 5 % over 180 days.                                                              |

These convergent observations indicate that **the combination of an atomically thin, highly conductive (or optically resonant) 2-D platform, a high-affinity molecular recognizer, and an auxiliary signal-amplification step (DEP, PC, or anti-fouling brush) is the decisive factor for achieving the required performance metrics**. Where claims differ across studies, normalizing to particle size distribution, polymer density, and matrix conductivity is necessary to obtain comparable figures of merit.

| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FET (MXene-Aptamer-DEP)**                           | Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene channel, 2′-O-Me aptamer, solution-gated DEP pre-concentration | LOD = 10² particles L⁻¹ (single-particle), response < 2 s, drift ≤ 5 % over 30 days              | Metallic conductance → ultra-low noise; DEP enables rapid pre-concentration         | HF-based MXene synthesis raises environmental concerns; aptamer nuclease stability in wastewater needs protection                                   |
| **Optical PC (MoS₂-MIP-Dual-Recognition)**            | MoS₂ monolayer in dielectric PC, MIP + aptamer, wavelength-shift read-out    | LOD ≈ 0.2 µg L⁻¹ (≈ 10³ particles L⁻¹), Q-factor ≥ 5 000, response ≈ 12 s                        | Label-free, multiplexable via wavelength channels; high Q amplifies tiny RI changes | Air-sensitive 2-D materials (MoS₂, perovskite) require encapsulation; optical read-out can be compromised by turbidity                              |
| **EIS (Graphene-GQD-Peptide)**                        | Few-layer graphene + GQD IDE, 2 nm peptide, dynamic N-aryl-hydrazone linker  | LOD ≈ 2 pg L⁻¹, response ≈ 8 s, regeneration ≤ 120 s, > 10 000 cycles, drift < 5 % over 180 days | Ultra-low LOD, built-in anti-fouling brushes, IoT-ready edge ML                     | GQD distribution uniformity in roll-to-roll may vary; impedance spectra of similar polymers overlap, limiting multiplexing without auxiliary optics |
| **Hybrid MXene-GO PC (Electrical-Optical Dual Mode)** | Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene + GO PC, MIP layer, simultaneous FET & resonance read-out      | LOD ≈ 0.5 µg L⁻¹, response ≈ 10 s, self-referencing reduces false positives in turbid water      | Dual-mode provides redundancy; electrical channel tolerant to scattering            | Increased fabrication complexity; alignment of PC and FET regions critical                                                                          |
| **Paper-Based Disposable MXene-DEP-FET**              | Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene printed on cellulose, DEP electrodes, single-use               | Cost < \$0.01 per sensor, LOD ≈ 10³ particles L⁻¹, response ≈ 5 s                                | Ultra-low cost for citizen-science campaigns                                        | No regeneration; waste generation; limited shelf-life due to MXene oxidation                                                                        |

## 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution

| Contradiction                                                             | Source(s)                                                                                                                               | Analysis & Possible Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sensitivity superiority of MXene-Aptamer-FET vs. Graphene-Aptamer-FET** | Branch A claims single-particle detection (< 2 s); a counter-statement notes graphene-aptamer FETs achieving 10³ particles L⁻¹ in 5 s.  | The discrepancy stems from **device architecture**: MXene’s metallic sheet resistance yields a lower noise floor, while graphene devices in the cited study used back-gate geometry with higher parasitic capacitance. When graphene is employed in a solution-gated, high-κ dielectric configuration at comparable Debye lengths and channel geometries, its sensitivity approaches that of MXene, but MXene still retains a modest edge due to intrinsic higher carrier density. |
| **Aptamer stability in seawater**                                         | Branch A asserts > 6 months stability; counter-statement warns of nuclease degradation.                                                 | Aptamer longevity depends on **chemical modification**. The original MXene-aptamer work employed 2′-O-Me and phosphorothioate backbones, which confer nuclease resistance up to several months. However, in highly active wastewater microbiomes, additional protection (e.g., PEGylation or encapsulation in a thin silica shell) may be required. The contradiction is therefore contextual rather than absolute.                                                                |
| **Power consumption of DEP pre-concentration**                            | Branch A claims < 100 mW; counter-statement notes high-frequency AC fields may increase draw.                                           | DEP power scales with voltage amplitude, frequency, and electrode geometry. Optimised interdigitated designs (10 µm pitch) can achieve sufficient particle trapping at 5 V pp, 500 kHz, reducing power to ≈ 30 mW. The higher-power estimate reflects a conservative design with 20 V pp. Both statements are valid for different design points.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Multiplexing capability**                                               | Branch A suggests polymer-specific aptamer arrays can differentiate mixtures; counter-statement says cross-reactivity not demonstrated. | Multiplexing has been shown in **proof-of-concept** using three aptamers (PE, PS, PET) on separate FET channels, achieving > 80 % classification accuracy. However, full field-scale validation with complex mixtures remains pending, explaining the cautious counter-statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Optical vs. dual-mode read-out in turbid water**                        | Branch B claims pure optical PC yields lowest LOD; counter-statement argues dual-mode is necessary.                                     | Optical PCs are highly sensitive in clear water, but scattering in turbid matrices reduces resonance contrast. Dual-mode devices (optical + electrical) retain sensitivity by using the electrical channel as a reference, thus both claims are correct for different sample conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

**Overall Resolution:** The contradictions are largely **parameter-dependent** (device geometry, sample matrix, protective chemistries) rather than fundamental disagreements. By acknowledging the operating envelope of each claim, a coherent picture emerges: MXene-aptamer-DEP-FET excels in ultra-fast, low-LOD detection in high-ionic, relatively clear water; PC-MIP platforms provide label-free optical sensitivity and multiplexing in moderately turbid environments; peptide-GQD-EIS delivers the deepest LOD and longest continuous operation, especially when integrated with IoT edge analytics. Across platforms, rigorous control of pH and ionic strength to stabilize the electrical double layer is the leading determinant of repeatability.

## 4. Unique Perspective Insights

### 4.1 Hybrid MXene-Aptamer DEP-FET (Branch A)

* **Dielectrophoretic Pre-Concentration:** The integration of DEP directly on the sensor chip is a distinctive strategy that compresses the sampling volume by > 10⁴-fold, enabling single-particle detection without external sample preparation.
* **Printing-Based Mass Production:** Demonstrated ink-jet and gravure printing of Ti₃C₂Tₓ inks with < 5 % device-to-device variation is a rare example of a high-performance nanomaterial being fabricated at commodity-scale cost.
* **Regeneration Simplicity:** A brief urea or low-pH buffer rinse restores aptamer binding capacity, supporting repeated on-site measurements—a practical advantage over irreversible MIP layers.

### 4.2 Photonic-Crystal-Enhanced MoS₂-MIP (Branch B)

* **Hybrid Optical Resonance:** Embedding a 2-D semiconductor within a high-Q photonic crystal creates a **dual-enhancement**: the excitonic absorption of MoS₂ amplifies the evanescent field, while the PC magnifies the refractive-index shift caused by polymer binding.
* **Dual-Recognition (MIP + Aptamer/Peptide):** Adding a secondary, highly specific probe to the broadly selective MIP dramatically improves polymer-type discrimination, a novel approach that bridges the gap between “broad-spectrum” and “single-polymer” sensors.
* **Self-Referencing Capability:** The same PC can host a reference cavity (non-imprinted) alongside the sensing cavity, enabling real-time compensation for temperature, salinity, and bulk refractive-index fluctuations, and in coastal waters with NTU ≳ 5 this referencing contributes more to stability than absolute sensitivity.

### 4.3 Peptide-Functionalized Graphene-Quantum-Dot EIS (Branch C)

* **Dynamic Covalent Linkers:** The use of reversible N-aryl-hydrazone or disulfide chemistries provides **on-chip regeneration** without mechanical cleaning, a rare feature for impedance sensors that typically require harsh chemical stripping.
* **Zwitterionic Anti-Fouling Brushes:** Incorporating PMPC or PSBMA brushes directly on the graphene surface suppresses bio-fouling by > 95 % even in nutrient-rich marine water, extending sensor lifetime far beyond conventional EIS platforms.
* **Edge-Computing & Machine-Learning:** Real-time deconvolution of multi-frequency impedance spectra using lightweight PCA + random-forest models on an ESP32-C3 microcontroller enables **in-situ polymer identification** (up to four polymer types) without cloud dependence, with resilience to temperature drift after on-board baseline correction.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The multi-perspective analysis converges on a **design paradigm** that couples an atomically thin, electrically or optically resonant 2-D material with a **high-affinity, chemically robust molecular recognizer**, and augments the transduction with a **signal-amplification or anti-fouling strategy**.

| Platform                                            | Material                    | Recognition                               | Transduction                                    | Best-in-Class Metric                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ultra-fast, low-cost field sensor**               | Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene (printed)     | 2′-O-Me/PS-modified DNA aptamer           | Solution-gated FET + DEP pre-concentration      | LOD = 10² particles L⁻¹, response < 2 s, per-chip cost ≈ \$0.05 |
| **Label-free optical multiplexing**                 | MoS₂ monolayer in high-Q PC | MIP + secondary aptamer/peptide           | Resonance wavelength shift (dual-mode optional) | LOD ≈ 0.2 µg L⁻¹, Q ≥ 5 000, response ≈ 12 s                    |
| **Deepest detection limit & continuous monitoring** | Few-layer graphene + GQD    | 2 nm amphipathic peptide (dynamic linker) | Electrochemical impedance (IDE) with edge-ML    | LOD ≈ 2 pg L⁻¹, regeneration ≤ 120 s, > 10 000 cycles           |

**Sensitivity:** The graphene-GQD-EIS platform reaches the lowest reported LOD (2 pg L⁻¹) under controlled matrices, surpassing the MXene-FET (single-particle) and PC-MIP (0.2 µg L⁻¹).

**Selectivity:** Aptamer-based MXene sensors and dual-recognition MIP/aptamer PCs both achieve > 100-fold discrimination against NOM and > 1 000-fold against ions, although eco-corona formation on weathered plastics can attenuate apparent specificity without recalibration. Peptide receptors provide broad-polymer affinity with sub-nanomolar K\_D, and when combined with zwitterionic brushes, maintain selectivity even in high-salinity, fouling-prone waters.

**Response Time:** MXene-DEP-FET is the fastest (< 2 s) due to active particle trapping; PC-MIP sensors require \~10 s for resonance stabilization; EIS sensors settle within 8–12 s after baseline correction.

**Scalability & Sustainability:** Printed MXene arrays and roll-to-roll graphene-GQD IDEs demonstrate viable mass-production pathways. PC-MIP devices, while more complex, are compatible with NIL roll-to-roll and can be fabricated on flexible substrates. Environmental concerns surrounding HF-based MXene synthesis and MXene oxidation can be mitigated by **green-chemistry routes** (e.g., Li-intercalation exfoliation) and protective polymer over-coats. Alternatively, fluoride-free or molten-salt routes can reduce F-termination but may alter surface terminations and conductivity, so device figures of merit should be re-benchmarked after such process changes.

**Overall Answer to the Research Question:**

* **Top-performing 2-D materials:** Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene, MoS₂ monolayer, few-layer graphene (with GQD).
* **Most effective recognizers:** Chemically stabilized DNA aptamers, molecularly imprinted polymers combined with secondary aptamers/peptides, and short amphipathic peptides linked through reversible covalent chemistry.
* **Optimal transduction strategies:** Solution-gated FETs with DEP pre-concentration for ultra-rapid detection; high-Q photonic-crystal resonators for label-free optical multiplexing; impedance spectroscopy with built-in anti-fouling brushes and on-chip regeneration for ultra-low LOD and long-term autonomous operation.

In practice, the **choice of platform** should be guided by the intended deployment scenario: rapid screening of drinking-water intake points favours MXene-DEP-FET; monitoring of coastal or estuarine turbidity-rich sites benefits from PC-MIP dual-mode sensors; long-duration surveillance of wastewater treatment effluents or marine habitats is best served by peptide-functionalized graphene-GQD EIS devices integrated with IoT edge analytics.
