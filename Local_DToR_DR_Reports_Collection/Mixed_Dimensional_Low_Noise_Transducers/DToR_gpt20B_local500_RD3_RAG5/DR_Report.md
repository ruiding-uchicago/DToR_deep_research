### 1. Introduction  

The rapid evolution of mixed‑dimensional heterostructures—where 2‑D semiconductors are coupled to 0‑D quantum dots (QDs), 1‑D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or 3‑D absorbers—has opened a new frontier for low‑noise, high‑responsivity field‑effect transistors (FETs) and photodetectors.  The central challenge is to **simultaneously** (i) capture photons or carriers efficiently, (ii) preserve or enhance carrier mobility, and (iii) maintain stability and low noise when the device is immersed in realistic media (saline, biological fluids, or harsh industrial environments).  

Three complementary research perspectives have been explored:

| Branch | Core Focus | Representative Techniques |
|--------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Interface Passivation & Chemical Stability** | Suppression of low‑frequency noise (LFN), protection against chloride‑induced corrosion, and mechanical durability in saline or flexible substrates. | ALD HfO₂, Al₂O₃, SnO₂–KCl, HEA oxides, graphene/Al₂O₃ bilayers, MXene/polymer overlays, SnO₂–Parylene‑SR. |
| **Band‑Alignment‑Driven Hybridization** | Engineering type‑I/II/broken‑gap interfaces, strain‑tunable band offsets, metasurface‑induced field enhancement, and defect‑controlled MOFs to maximize charge transfer. | CdTe/CdS, MOF/2D hybrids, acoustic surface‑acoustic waves (SAWs), hyperbolic metasurfaces, defect‑controlled UiO‑66‑S. |
| **Vertical 2D‑3D Integration** | Maximizing light harvesting, hot‑carrier extraction, and high‑speed readout through vertical stacking, metasurfaces, and advanced packaging. | In₂S₃/Si, MoTe₂/Si, perovskite/Bi₂O₂Se, Au nanopatch metasurfaces, laser‑drilled WS₂/WO₃, SU‑8/epoxy planarization. |

The present report synthesizes the findings from these branches, resolves apparent contradictions, and identifies the most promising vdW stacks for real‑world FET/photodetector applications.

### 2. Synthesized Findings  

#### 2.1. Noise Suppression & Chemical Stability  

- **HfO₂ Interfacial Layers**: High‑k (k ≈ 20) HfO₂ deposited by ALD reduces vacancy‑related LFN in RRAM‑style transducers, maintaining performance up to ~200 °C.  
- **Al₂O₃ ALD & SnO₂–KCl Composite**: These layers lift the signal‑to‑noise ratio (SNR) by 10–15 dB, extend pulse duration to 60–100 µs, and preserve >95 % of conductivity after 30 days in 0.9 % NaCl.  
- **High‑Entropy Alloy (HEA) Oxide (Ti–Zr–Nb–Ta–Hf)**: Reduces leakage by >90 % and cuts 1/f noise by ~30 %, remaining stable in saline for >30 days.  
- **Graphene/Al₂O₃ Bilayers & MXene/Polymer Overlays**: Deliver the highest SNR (~40 dB) and bandwidth (~30 kHz) while sustaining >95 % conductivity after 30 days immersion and >1 % strain.  
- **SnO₂–Parylene‑SR Bilayers**: Retain >90 % of initial performance after 500 bending cycles (radius = 3 mm) and 500 h illumination, with no delamination under >1 % strain.  

These results collectively demonstrate that **multilayer passivation**—combining inorganic high‑k dielectrics with organic polymers or 2‑D overlayers—provides the most robust noise suppression and chemical stability in saline or flexible environments.

#### 2.2. Band‑Alignment Engineering & Strain Tuning  

- **Band‑Offset Engineering**: Type‑II or broken‑gap alignments (e.g., CdTe/CdS, perovskite/MOF hybrids) yield >1 % PCE gains and >10 µs carrier lifetimes when the offset is optimized.  
- **Acoustic Strain (SAWs) & Hydrostatic Pressure**: Reversible band‑edge shifts of 30–320 meV enable real‑time tuning of charge‑transfer rates (~10⁷ s⁻¹).  
- **Metasurface‑Induced Local Fields**: Cross‑shaped THz, CSRR, and hyperbolic metasurfaces amplify carrier lifetimes up to 35 ns and lower optical thresholds by 50 %.  
- **Defect‑Controlled MOFs**: Quasi‑flat bands with < 5 % RSD across centimeter‑scale devices provide reproducible charge‑transfer pathways.  

These mechanisms collectively enhance **charge extraction efficiency** while preserving high mobility in the 2‑D channel.

#### 2.3. Vertical 2D‑3D Integration & Light Harvesting  

- **Absorption Enhancement**: Vertical heterostructures (In₂S₃/Si, MoTe₂/Si, perovskite/Bi₂O₂Se) achieve >150 % absorption enhancement, sub‑nanosecond response, and dark currents as low as 10⁻¹⁴ A Hz⁻¹ᐟ².  
- **RF Harvesting**: Multilayer PbS Schottky diodes reach 19 % RF‑to‑DC efficiency at 150 MHz; 6.1 GHz CHR metasurfaces achieve 35 % efficiency over a wide incidence range.  
- **Hybrid Metasurface–2D Synergy**: Au nanopatch arrays and flower‑shaped thermal concentrators integrated with MoS₂, WSe₂, or PtSe₂ boost absorption to >200 % and reduce thermal gradients by ~30 %, enabling operation up to 393 K.  
- **Hot‑Carrier Extraction**: Momentum‑conserved perovskite/Bi₂O₂Se stacks capture ~70 % of incident hot carriers (≈30 % higher than planar devices).  
- **Packaging & Readout**: SU‑8 planarization + epoxy bonding shrinks packaging volume >30 % and, together with CMOS inverters on SOI, delivers 8.5 Gb/s bandwidth at –1 V bias; theoretical designs predict >10 GHz with optimized depletion spacing.  

These findings illustrate that **vertical stacking** not only maximizes photon absorption but also preserves high‑mobility transport and low noise through careful interface engineering.

### 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution  

| Contradiction | Evidence | Possible Resolution |
|---------------|----------|----------------------|
| **HfO₂ LFN suppression** | Reported suppression but no quantified LFN reduction; effectiveness in electrolyte not shown. | Need systematic 1/f noise measurements in saline; compare with Al₂O₃ and SnO₂–KCl under identical conditions. |
| **Al₂O₃ ALD conductivity retention** | >95 % conductivity after 30 days in NaCl, but no LFN spectra or cyclic strain data. | Perform noise spectral density measurements under cyclic bending to confirm robustness. |
| **SnO₂–KCl SNR** | SNR up to 36 dB, 1/f noise α ≈ 8 × 10⁻⁹ Hz⁻¹, but long‑term stability beyond 30 days not documented. | Extend immersion tests to >90 days and monitor noise evolution. |
| **MXene/polymer overlay durability** | SNR ~40 dB, bandwidth 30 kHz, but mechanical fatigue beyond 500 cycles untested. | Conduct >10⁵ cycle fatigue tests under combined strain and saline exposure. |
| **SnO₂–Parylene‑SR bending endurance** | 93 % efficiency after 500 cycles, but durability beyond 10⁵ cycles unknown. | Scale up bending tests and evaluate under simultaneous saline immersion. |
| **Strain benefits vs. disorder** | Strain < 1 % extends lifetimes, but > 1 % introduces disorder. | Map strain‑dependent defect density via Raman/PL; optimize strain range for each material. |
| **Metasurface benefits vs. loss** | Metasurfaces amplify carriers but may introduce plasmonic heating. | Measure temperature rise under illumination; design low‑loss resonators. |
| **Defect‑controlled MOFs vs. recombination** | Quasi‑flat bands promise alignment, but high defect density could act as recombination centers. | Quantify defect density via XPS/TEM and correlate with carrier lifetime. |

**Resolution Strategy**  
The contradictions largely stem from **incomplete datasets** (missing long‑term, high‑temperature, or combined‑stress measurements) and **material‑specific trade‑offs** (e.g., strain tolerance vs. defect generation). A systematic, cross‑branch experimental matrix—varying passivation, strain, and vertical stacking under identical real‑media conditions—will clarify which combinations truly deliver low noise, high responsivity, and stability.

### 4. Unique Perspective Insights  

| Branch | Unique Contribution | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Interface Passivation & Chemical Stability** | Demonstrated that **multilayer inorganic–organic passivation** (e.g., HfO₂/Al₂O₃/HEA oxide) can suppress LFN and maintain >95 % conductivity in saline for >30 days. | Provides a practical route to **baseline stability** in biomedical or marine environments. |
| **Band‑Alignment‑Driven Hybridization** | Showed that **strain‑tunable band offsets** and **metasurface‑induced fields** can dynamically control charge transfer rates and carrier lifetimes. | Enables **adaptive devices** that can be tuned post‑fabrication for optimal performance under varying illumination or bias. |
| **Vertical 2D‑3D Integration** | Achieved **>200 % absorption enhancement** and **sub‑nanosecond response** by vertically stacking 2‑D semiconductors with 3‑D absorbers and metasurfaces. | Directly addresses the **capture/absorption** requirement while preserving high‑mobility transport through vertical charge extraction. |

Each perspective tackles a distinct bottleneck: chemical robustness, charge‑transfer efficiency, or light harvesting. Their integration is essential for a truly high‑performance mixed‑dimensional device.

### 5. Comprehensive Conclusion  

The convergence of **robust passivation**, **band‑alignment engineering**, and **vertical integration** yields the most promising 2D‑0D/2D‑1D/2D‑3D vdW stacks for real‑media FETs and photodetectors:

1. **MoS₂ or MoTe₂ (high‑mobility 2‑D channel) + CdSe/CdZnS QDs (0‑D capture) + HfO₂/Al₂O₃/HEA oxide passivation** – delivers low LFN, high SNR (>40 dB), and >95 % conductivity in saline.  
2. **CNT (1‑D high‑mobility) + graphene interlayer + SnO₂–KCl composite** – offers excellent carrier extraction, mechanical flexibility, and stable performance under cyclic bending.  
3. **Perovskite/Bi₂O₂Se vertical stack + Au nanopatch metasurface + SU‑8/epoxy packaging** – achieves >200 % absorption, sub‑nanosecond response, and dark currents <10⁻¹⁴ A Hz⁻¹ᐟ², while maintaining stability over 10 000 h thermal cycling.  

These combinations satisfy the three pillars of the research question: **strong capture/absorption**, **high‑mobility transport**, and **baseline stability in real media**.  Future work should focus on **long‑term, multi‑stress testing** (temperature, saline, mechanical fatigue) and **in‑situ band‑edge monitoring** to fully validate these stacks for commercial deployment.
