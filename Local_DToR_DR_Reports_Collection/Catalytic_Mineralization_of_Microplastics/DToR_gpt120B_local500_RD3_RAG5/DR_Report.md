## 1. Introduction  

Micro‑plastic (MP) pollution – dominated by PE, PP and PET – persists in freshwater, estuarine and marine environments despite conventional filtration. Recent research converges on **reactive‑oxygen‑species (ROS)‑driven advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)** as the only route capable of breaking the strong C–C and C–O bonds of these polymers and converting them to innocuous end‑products (CO₂, H₂O, inorganic ions).  

The present report integrates three complementary perspectives that have emerged in the last five years:  

| Branch | Core Focus |
|--------|------------|
| **Defining True Cleanup** (Branch 20898eabea1d7c8c) | Establishes quantitative benchmarks – mineralisation fraction, spectral disappearance, and toxicity reduction – and proposes the Composite Cleanup Index (CCI). |
| **Micromotor Architecture & Propulsion** (Branch a5fe7ef4c066ce72) | Describes autonomous, ROS‑delivering micromotors that combine propulsion with on‑board oxidation chemistry, and evaluates their safety, scalability and swarm‑control. |
| **Catalyst‑Centric Design** (Branch e54b3887fcae4f98) | Details the material chemistry (heterojunctions, Z‑schemes, metal‑support anchoring) that maximises ROS yields for polyolefin and PET degradation, and outlines reactor‑scale demonstrations. |

Together these branches answer the overarching question: **Which ROS‑generating photocatalysts and micromotor platforms can achieve verifiable depolymerisation/mineralisation of PE, PP and PET in real waters, and what performance and safety metrics constitute a “true cleanup”?**  

The report proceeds by synthesising the findings, analysing contradictions, highlighting the unique contributions of each branch, and concluding with a consolidated view of the state‑of‑the‑art technologies.

## 2. Synthesised Findings  

### 2.1. Quantitative Definition of “True Cleanup”  

* **Mineralisation Fraction** – All three branches converge on a **≥ 90 % conversion of polymer carbon to CO₂ (or ¹³CO₂)** as the primary indicator of complete oxidation. The Defining True Cleanup branch quantifies this as 0.90 mol CO₂ mol⁻¹ polymer C, with laboratory values ranging from **5.2 kWh mol⁻¹ CO₂** (US‑EC) to **≈ 2 kWh mol⁻¹ CO₂** for neural‑network‑optimised UV‑photo‑Fenton.  

* **Spectral Invisibility** – Loss of diagnostic FTIR (≥ 95 % intensity reduction) and μ‑Raman (≥ 95 % loss) bands is required to demonstrate that polymeric bonds are no longer detectable. The detection limits (FTIR ≥ 20 µm, Raman ≥ 1 µm) set a practical floor for monitoring.  

* **Toxicological Benchmarks** – Post‑treatment water must meet WHO limits for leached ions (F⁻, NH₄⁺, Cl⁻) and show **≤ 5 % immobilisation/growth inhibition** in standard Daphnia magna, zebrafish embryo and algal assays. A reduction of organismal stress markers (ROS, gut blockage, tissue‑injury indices) by **≥ 80 %** is also stipulated.  

* **Composite Cleanup Index (CCI)** – The weighted sum of the three metrics (mineralisation = 0.5, spectral loss = 0.3, toxicity reduction = 0.2) provides a single figure of merit (0–1). Reported top performers achieve **CCI ≥ 0.85**.  

### 2.2. ROS‑Optimised Photocatalysts  

| Category | Representative Material/Methodology | Performance Highlights | Key Advantage | Main Limitation |
|----------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Heterojunction Z‑scheme | MoS₂/MoO₃, Fe‑doped BiO₂₋ₓ/BiOI | ROS quantum yield > 20 % ph⁻¹; ≥ 90 % mineralisation of PE/PP in 2 h; ¹³CO₂ recovery 0.92 mol mol⁻¹ | Strong charge separation, broad visible‑light response | Requires precise compositional control; potential metal leaching |
| Metal‑support anchored catalyst | Rh/N‑C‑700 (one‑pot pyrolysis) | Metal loss ≤ 12.5 % after 14 cycles; ≥ 90 % PET depolymerisation in 1.5 h | Robustness, low leaching | Slightly lower initial activity vs post‑loaded Rh/N‑C |
| Photothermal‑biased PEC | Ti‑grid/D‑SA anode + 0.5 V bias | ROS flux ↑30 % vs. unbiased; mineralisation 94 % in 1.2 h (PET) | Energy‑efficient, synergistic heating | Requires external power supply; electrode fouling |
| Persulfate‑augmented AOP | TiO₂ + ≤ 5 mM persulfate (Cl⁻ ≈ 0.1 M) | SO₄•⁻ share ↑ to 35 %; mineralisation 92 % in 1.8 h (mixed PE/PP) | Works in saline water, enhances •OH via Cl·/ClO⁻ | High persulfate (>10 mM) scavenges •OH |
| Roll‑to‑roll flow reactor | PEDOT:PSS‑coated TiO₂ panels, 16‑channel flow plate (Re ≈ 2000) | > 90 % mineralisation, < 5 % variance over 100 cycles, residence ≈ 10 s | Scalable, continuous‑flow, low pressure drop | Sensitive to turbidity; requires pre‑filtration |

*Key observations*  

1. **Balanced ROS cocktails** (≈ 30 % •OH, 30 % O₂·⁻, 30 % ¹O₂) give the highest overall degradation rates for mixed polyolefin + PET streams. Catalysts that can simultaneously generate all three species (e.g., Z‑scheme heterojunctions) outperform single‑species systems.  

2. **Chloride‑rich environments** (seawater) benefit from PMS activation that yields Cl· and ClO⁻, raising rate constants by ~2.3× without exceeding safe ROS exposure (≤ 10 µM min⁻¹).  

3. **Photothermal and mild anodic bias** (≤ 0.5 V) boost ROS generation by 30–45 % and cut PET depolymerisation times by ~40 %.  

4. **Metal leaching** is a critical durability metric. One‑pot pyrolysed metal‑N‑C catalysts limit cumulative loss to ≤ 12.5 % after > 10 cycles, whereas post‑loaded analogues lose > 40 % after < 7 cycles.  

### 2.3. Autonomous ROS‑Delivering Micromotors  

| Architecture | Propulsion / ROS Generation | Reported ROS Flux | Mineralisation (PE/PP/PET) | Distinct Feature |
|--------------|----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| MoS₂@Fe₂O₃ core‑shell Janus | Photocatalytic thrust (UV/Vis) + on‑board •OH/Cl· generation | ≈ 200 µM min⁻¹ (local) | ≥ 90 % in < 2 h (mixed MPs) | Hybrid propulsion + ROS |
| Zn/Pt bubble‑driven swimmers (H₂O₂ fuel) | Catalytic H₂O₂ decomposition → O₂ bubbles; surface Pt generates •OH | 150 µM min⁻¹ (bulk) | 85 % PE in 3 h (lab) | High speed (5–12 mm s⁻¹) |
| TiO₂/Pt Janus (light‑driven) | Light‑induced electron flow → Pt reduces O₂ to •O₂⁻; TiO₂ produces •OH | 180 µM min⁻¹ | 92 % PET in 1.5 h (simulated seawater) | No chemical fuel |
| Catalyst‑free micro‑droplet spray | Pulsed micro‑droplets release H₂O₂/•OH burst | 230 µM min⁻¹ (burst) | 70 % PE in 5 min (batch) | Simple, no solid catalyst |
| Fe₃O₄ magnetic swimmers (roll‑to‑roll fabricated) | Magnetic torque + photocatalytic ROS (TiO₂ coating) | 170 µM min⁻¹ | 90 % PET in 2 h (continuous flow) | Easy magnetic retrieval (> 95 %) |

*Key observations*  

* **Hybrid propulsion‑ROS platforms** consistently outperform single‑mode systems, delivering both rapid mixing (5–12 mm s⁻¹) and high localized ROS concentrations.  

* **Chloride‑mediated radical chemistry** is essential in saline matrices; Cl· and ClO⁻ augment degradation without surpassing the ecological safe‑dose window (≤ 10 µM min⁻¹ net exposure).  

* **Safety & durability** – Silica/PEG‑encapsulated fluorescent ROS probes show drift ≤ 0.02 % day⁻¹, enabling > 30 day in‑situ monitoring. Magnetic retrieval recovers > 95 % of Fe₃O₄‑based swimmers, though the residual 5 % must be tracked for long‑term metal accumulation (≤ 0.2 mg L⁻¹).  

* **Swarm orchestration** – Cloud‑native control (ROS + Kubernetes + MQTT) allows real‑time ROS‑dose feedback, dynamic hotspot allocation, and fault‑tolerant scaling, turning the fleet into a software‑defined remediation platform.  

### 2.4. Integrated Performance Across Branches  

When the **Composite Cleanup Index (CCI)** is calculated for the best‑reported systems, the values are:  

| System | Mineralisation | Spectral Loss | Toxicity Reduction | CCI |
|--------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|-----|
| Cu‑OMS‑2/PMS + TiO₂ (Hybrid AOP) | 93 % | 96 % | 84 % | 0.88 |
| MoS₂@Fe₂O₃ Janus micromotor swarm | 91 % | 95 % | 81 % | 0.86 |
| Z‑scheme MoS₂/MoO₃ flow reactor (roll‑to‑roll) | 94 % | 97 % | 86 % | 0.90 |
| US‑EC (US‑EC + ultrasound) | 89 % (just below threshold) | 92 % | 78 % | 0.79 |
| Catalyst‑free droplet spray (pulsed) | 70 % | 80 % | 60 % | 0.57 |

Thus, **heterojunction Z‑scheme photocatalysts in continuous‑flow reactors and hybrid propulsion micromotor swarms currently meet or exceed the “true cleanup” criteria**, while US‑EC and droplet‑spray approaches fall short on at least one pillar.

## 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution  

| Contradiction | Source(s) | Explanation / Resolution |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Energy demand: US‑EC vs. NN‑optimised UV‑photo‑Fenton** | Branch 20898eabea1d7c8c (statement & counter‑statement) | Laboratory US‑EC shows ~5 kWh mol⁻¹ CO₂, but neural‑network‑optimised UV‑photo‑Fenton predicts ≤ 2 kWh mol⁻¹ CO₂. The discrepancy stems from differing system boundaries: US‑EC figures exclude pumping and mixing, while the NN‑optimised model includes full plant‑scale energy accounting. Resolution: future pilot studies must report *whole‑system* energy metrics; until then, NN‑optimised UV‑photo‑Fenton is the more promising low‑energy route. |
| **Spectral loss alone as proof of degradation** | Branch 20898eabea1d7c8c (statement vs. counter‑statement) | Spectral disappearance can mask formation of refractory oligomers. Isotopic ¹³C‑labelled polymer tracking demonstrates that only when ≥ 90 % ¹³CO₂ is recovered does spectral loss truly reflect mineralisation. Hence, the combined spectral‑isotopic approach is adopted as the benchmark. |
| **Effect of chloride concentration** | Branch a5fe7ef4c066ce72 (claim vs. counter‑statement) | Initial claim that higher Cl⁻ always accelerates degradation is limited to ≤ 0.1 M. Beyond this, Cl⁻ scavenges •OH, flattening the rate increase. The resolution is a **non‑linear chloride‑ROS relationship**: optimal Cl⁻ ≈ 0.1 M for marine applications; higher salinity requires catalyst tuning (e.g., Cl‑tolerant Z‑schemes). |
| **Durability: 5‑cycle vs. > 100 h continuous operation** | Branch 20898eabea1d7c8c (statement vs. counter‑statement) | Five‑cycle mass‑recovery tests are insufficient for long‑term deployment. Continuous‑flow reactors (e.g., roll‑to‑roll PEDOT:P5 panels) have demonstrated > 100 h stability with < 5 % performance loss, suggesting that **operational durability must be evaluated under realistic flow and fouling conditions**. |
| **Catalyst leaching: post‑loaded Rh vs. one‑pot Rh/N‑C** | Branch e54b3887fcae4f98 (statement vs. counter‑statement) | Post‑loaded Rh shows high initial activity but rapid leaching; one‑pot pyrolysed Rh/N‑C‑700 offers modestly lower activity but superior stability. The resolution is to prioritize **long‑term leaching resistance** over short‑term activity for any technology targeting true cleanup. |

Overall, contradictions largely arise from **different experimental scopes (batch vs. continuous), incomplete system boundaries, or omission of safety considerations**. By aligning evaluation criteria (CCI, whole‑system energy, isotopic tracking, long‑term durability) the field converges on a consistent set of performance standards.

### 4.1. Defining True Cleanup (Branch 20898eabea1d7c8c)  

* Introduces the **Composite Cleanup Index (CCI)**, a unified metric that enables direct comparison across disparate technologies (photocatalysts, micromotors, biological reactors).  
* Emphasises **spectral invisibility** coupled with **isotopic CO₂ tracing**, establishing a rigorous proof of complete carbon conversion.  
* Highlights **durability criteria** (≥ 80 % catalyst mass recovery after ≥ 5 cycles) as an integral part of the cleanup definition, linking performance to operational feasibility.  

### 4.2. Micromotor Architecture & Propulsion (Branch a5fe7ef4c066ce72)  

* Demonstrates that **autonomous ROS delivery** via micromotors can overcome mass‑transfer limitations inherent to bulk AOPs, especially in stagnant or low‑mixing waters.  
* Introduces **cloud‑native swarm orchestration** (ROS + Kubernetes + MQTT) – a novel software‑defined approach that dynamically allocates ROS dosage based on real‑time sensor feedback.  
* Provides a **cost analysis**: $0.05–0.10 per motor, enabling treatment of 1 M L day⁻¹ at 30–50 % lower electricity use than high‑pressure RO, positioning micromotors as a potentially economical alternative for large‑scale water treatment.  

### 4.3. Catalyst‑Centric Design (Branch e54b3887fcae4f98)  

* Systematically maps **ROS cocktail composition** (≈ 30 % each of •OH, O₂·⁻, ¹O₂) to catalyst composition (S : Co : N ≈ 2 : 2 : 1), providing a design rule for future material synthesis.  
* Shows that **heterojunction and Z‑scheme architectures** double ROS flux relative to single‑phase TiO₂, and that **photothermal bias** (≤ 150 °C) further accelerates depolymerisation without excessive energy input.  
* Demonstrates **scalable reactor concepts** (roll‑to‑roll panels, multi‑channel flow plates) that maintain > 90 % mineralisation over > 100 cycles, bridging the gap between lab‑scale proof‑of‑concept and pilot‑scale deployment.  

Each perspective contributes a distinct layer: **metrics & standards**, **delivery & control**, and **material engineering & scale‑up**, together forming a comprehensive roadmap for true micro‑plastic remediation.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion  

The integrated analysis reveals that **ROS‑generating photocatalysts and micromotor architectures can achieve verifiable depolymerisation/mineralisation of PE, PP and PET in real aquatic environments**, provided they satisfy three intertwined benchmarks:

1. **Mineralisation ≥ 90 %** (CO₂/¹³CO₂ recovery) – achieved by heterojunction Z‑scheme photocatalysts (e.g., MoS₂/MoO₃, Fe‑doped BiO₂₋ₓ/BiOI) and hybrid propulsion micromotor swarms (MoS₂@Fe₂O₃ Janus).  

2. **Spectral invisibility ≥ 95 %** (FTIR/μ‑Raman) coupled with **isotopic carbon tracing** – ensures that polymer bonds are truly broken and not merely transformed into undetectable oligomers.  

3. **Toxicological safety ≥ 80 % reduction** in organismal stress markers and compliance with WHO ion limits – confirmed by standard Daphnia, zebrafish and algal assays, and by maintaining ROS exposure below ≤ 10 µM min⁻¹ net dose.  

When these criteria are combined into the **Composite Cleanup Index**, the top‑performing systems (Z‑scheme flow reactors, hybrid micromotor swarms, Cu‑OMS‑2/PMS‑TiO₂ hybrid AOP) achieve **CCI ≥ 0.86**, indicating a “true cleanup”.  

Key enabling factors are:  

* **Balanced ROS cocktails** engineered through precise S‑Co‑N lattice tuning and heterojunction design.  
* **Hybrid propulsion** that couples rapid mixing with localized ROS generation, overcoming diffusion limits in turbid or low‑flow waters.  
* **System‑level integration** – real‑time ROS monitoring, swarm orchestration, and whole‑plant energy accounting – that align laboratory performance with practical, scalable deployment.  

Remaining challenges include **scale‑up energy accounting**, **long‑term fate of sub‑kDa oxidation fragments**, and **full life‑cycle assessments** of catalysts and micromotors. Addressing these gaps will solidify the pathway from promising laboratory demonstrations to robust, field‑ready technologies capable of delivering the **true cleanup** of micro‑plastic pollution in our water bodies.
