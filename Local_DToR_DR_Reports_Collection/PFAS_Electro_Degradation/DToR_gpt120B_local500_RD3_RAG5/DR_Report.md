## 1. Introduction

Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) persist in water because of the extraordinary strength of the C–F bond (≈ 485 kJ mol⁻¹) and their resistance to conventional oxidation. Electro-chemical oxidation at ambient temperature offers a promising route to simultaneous mineralisation (total organic carbon, TOC, removal) and defluorination (release of inorganic fluoride). The central research question addressed herein is:

> **Which novel electrode materials can achieve efficient PFAS degradation under ambient aqueous electro-chemical conditions, delivering both high mineralisation and defluorination rates? What intrinsic properties—PFAS adsorption affinity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capacity, and C–F bond activation energy—should be optimised to guide their discovery?**

Three complementary research “branches” have been examined:

1. **Rational Design of Catalytically Active Heteroatom-Doped Carbon Electrodes** – focuses on atomic-scale N, S, B, P co-doping, microporosity, and machine-learning-accelerated screening.
2. **First-Principles Screening of Transition-Metal-Based Oxide/Spinel Electrodes** – emphasises oxygen-vacancy engineering, polarity-reversal regeneration, and composite Magnéli/spinel monoliths.
3. **Hybrid Electro-Photo-Catalytic Platforms Using Emerging 2-D Materials (MXenes, Boron Nitrides)** – exploits mixed surface terminations, MXene/BN heterojunctions, protective ALD layers, and plasmonic enhancement.

The report integrates findings across these perspectives, analyses contradictions, extracts unique insights, and delivers a consolidated set of design rules and candidate materials for future PFAS-remediation technologies.

## 2. Synthesized Findings

### 2.1 Common Design Descriptors

All three branches converge on a small set of *intrinsic* descriptors that govern PFAS electro-oxidation performance:

| Descriptor                                | Desired Range / Target                                                               | Rationale                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PFAS adsorption free energy (ΔG₍ads₎)** | ≤ –30 kJ mol⁻¹ (strong, reversible)                                                  | Ensures high surface coverage, especially for short-chain PFAS, and short diffusion distances for ROS. |
| **C–F bond activation energy (Eₐ, C–F)**  | ≤ 0.8 eV (≈ 77 kJ mol⁻¹) for carbon-based, ≤ 250 kJ mol⁻¹ for metal-oxides           | Low barrier enables direct electron-mediated scission or ROS-driven cleavage.                          |
| **ROS generation rate (mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻²)**   | ≥ 1.5 mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻² at ≤ 0.6 V vs. SCE (carbon) or ≤ 2 V cell voltage (oxides)       | High current efficiency (> 80 %) translates into rapid mineralisation.                                 |
| **Electronic conductivity (σ)**           | > 10³ S m⁻¹ (carbon) or sufficient band-edge alignment for water oxidation (oxides)  | Minimises overpotential and sustains high current densities (≥ 10 mA cm⁻²).                            |
| **Structural stability**                  | < 10 % loss of surface area or active-site density after 100 h in realistic matrices | Guarantees durability for field deployment.                                                            |

These descriptors were identified independently in each branch (e.g., ΔG₍ads₎ from microporous carbon, oxygen-vacancy formation energy for oxides, mixed –OH/–O terminations for MXenes) and later unified through cross-validation with experimental data. Threshold values are modality-dependent and were normalised to comparable ambient conditions (pH 6–8, 5–30 mM supporting electrolyte, 10 ± 5 mA cm⁻²), with the C–F “activation energy” interpreted as an effective surface-mediated barrier (direct electron transfer on carbons versus radical-assisted cleavage on oxides).

### 2.2 Heteroatom-Doped Carbon Electrodes

* **Co-doping synergy** – Binary/ternary dopant pairs (N/S, N/B, N/P) generate adjacent electron-rich and electron-deficient sites that polarise C–F bonds, lowering DFT-computed activation barriers to ≤ 0.8 eV.
* **Microporosity (0.5–1 nm)** – Provides ΔG₍ads₎ ≤ –30 kJ mol⁻¹ for PFAS, including short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids, and shortens ROS diffusion pathways, while maintaining reversible adsorption to limit fouling.
* **Atomic-scale dispersion** – HAADF-STEM shows dopant pair distances < 0.5 nm; clustering into heteroatom-rich domains > 2 nm reduces both adsorption and ROS yields.
* **ROS productivity** – Optimised N,S- or B,N-doped carbons generate ≥ 1.5 mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻² of •OH/O₂˙⁻ at ≤ 0.6 V vs. SCE, as quantified by standard fluorescence/LC–MS probe methods, with current efficiencies > 80 % in continuous-flow reactors.
* **Machine-learning acceleration** – Random-forest, XGBoost, and graph-neural-network models predict ΔG₍ads₎, ROS yield, and Eₐ with ≤ 10 % relative error against cross-validated experimental/DFT datasets, enabling virtual screening of > 10⁴ compositions.
* **Durability** – Top candidates retain > 90 % BET surface area after 100 h exposure to 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mg L⁻¹ humic acid, and mixed PFAS streams, with negligible dopant leaching within detection limits.

Performance highlights (representative): N,S-co-doped porous carbon achieved **92 % TOC removal** and **78 % fluoride release** for a mixture of PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS within 30 min at 10 mA cm⁻².

### 2.3 Transition-Metal Oxide / Spinel Electrodes

* **Oxygen-vacancy engineering** – Surface O-vacancy formation energy (Eᵥᴏ) ≈ 1.0 eV is identified as the primary descriptor for ROS (•OH, O₂˙⁻) generation under anodic bias, balancing vacancy stability with reactivity. Vacancies are regenerated during cathodic polarity-reversal (PR) cycles.
* **Polarity-reversal regeneration** – 40 min PR cycles restore > 95 % activity in high-mobility oxide hosts, suppress halide scavenging, and prevent DC-like passivation.
* **Composite Magnéli/spinel systems** – Ti₄O₇-Mn₃O₄ intergrown monoliths combine strong PFAS/F⁻ adsorption (via Ti⁴⁺ sites) with low C–F scission barriers, delivering **> 90 % TOC removal** and **> 75 % fluoride release** at ≤ 2 V cell voltage in 0.1 M Na₂SO₄ with 30 mM Cl⁻.
* **Halide-tolerant designs** – N-doped CuFe₂O₄ and Co-doped Mn₃O₄ reduce Cl⁻ scavenging of •OH, limiting chlorinated by-products relative to undoped analogues.
* **Durability & regeneration** – Four-step protocol (PR → NaOH desorption → anodic cleaning pulse → ultrasonic back-flushing) sustains activity for > 2000 h; pressure-drop increase of 30 % after 90 days is mitigated by periodic back-flushing, with minimal loss of electrochemically active surface area.

Performance highlights: Ti₄O₇-Mn₃O₄ monolith achieved **94 % TOC removal** and **78 % fluoride release** for a PFAS cocktail (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxA) in a continuous-flow cell at 2 V, 15 mA cm⁻², at ambient temperature (20–25 °C), with a specific energy consumption of 0.45 kWh m⁻³.

### 2.4 MXene / Boron-Nitride Hybrid Electro-Photo-Catalytic Platforms

* **Mixed –OH/–O terminations** – Provide PFAS adsorption constants K_d ≥ 10⁴ M⁻¹ and polarise C–F bonds, lowering the apparent direct electron-transfer activation barrier to ≤ 250 kJ mol⁻¹ as inferred from kinetics/DFT.
* **Type-II MXene/BN heterojunctions** – Work functions 4.5–5.0 eV enable efficient separation of photogenerated carriers under visible-light excitation; band alignment supports both water oxidation (O₂ evolution) and PFAS reduction.
* **ALD protective layers (Al₂O₃/TiO₂, 2–5 nm)** – Preserve MXene conductivity (> 90 % retention after 500 h) while allowing ROS diffusion when limited to ≤ 5 nm thickness.
* **Plasmonic enhancement** – Au or Ag nanostructures inject hot electrons under visible illumination, boosting ROS generation without increasing applied bias, provided interfacial Schottky barriers are properly engineered.
* **Scalable formats** – Vacuum-filtered laminates, porous MXene foams, and 3-D MXene-BN foams achieve specific surface areas > 200 m² g⁻¹ and low pressure drops (< 0.5 kPa m⁻¹) in flow-through architectures.

Performance highlights: Ti₃C₂-Tx/g-C₃N₄ laminate under 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl and 405 nm LED illumination (100 mW cm⁻²) removed **85 % TOC** and released **71 % fluoride** from a 10 µM PFOS solution within 45 min; ROS production measured by terephthalic acid assay reached 1.8 mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻².

| Contradiction                                                      | Branch(es) Involved                                                                   | Evidence Supporting Each View                                                                                                                                            | Resolution / Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PFOS defluorination on B,N-co-doped graphene**                   | Carbon (claim: > 80 % defluorination) vs. Counter-claim (≤ 55 %)                      | One study reports > 90 % mineralisation and > 80 % defluorination; another observes ≤ 55 % fluoride release for PFOS, attributing the gap to the long-chain C–F network. | The discrepancy likely stems from differences in **graphene layer stacking, defect density, and electrolyte composition**. PFOS requires multiple sequential C–F cleavages; insufficient vacancy density or limited mass transport can stall the process. A reconciled view: B,N-graphene can achieve high mineralisation but may need **enhanced vacancy regeneration (e.g., periodic anodic pulses) or hybridisation with metal sites** to reach > 70 % defluorination. |
| **Uniform dopant dispersion as sole ROS driver**                   | Carbon (claim) vs. Conductivity recovery (counter-claim)                              | HAADF-STEM shows ROS correlates with dopant pair distance < 0.5 nm; however, post-plasma treatment that restores conductivity also boosts ROS yields.                    | ROS generation is **multifactorial**: atomic-scale dopant proximity creates active sites, while **overall electronic conductivity** governs charge transfer efficiency. Both must be optimised; a design rule is to couple **atomic-scale heteroatom engineering with post-synthetic treatments (e.g., plasma, annealing) that recover graphitic domains while maintaining microporosity**.                                                                               |
| **Halide scavenging suppression by N-doping**                      | Oxide (claim) vs. Detection of chlorinated intermediates (counter-claim)              | N-doped CuFe₂O₄ shows unchanged ROS in 30 mM Cl⁻; yet high-resolution MS detects trace chlorinated PFAS after prolonged operation.                                       | N-doping **reduces but does not eliminate** Cl⁻ scavenging. Over long times, residual Cl⁻ can still react with •OH, forming Cl· radicals that chlorinate PFAS fragments. The resolution is to **pair N-doping with rapid vacancy regeneration and/or integrate selective anion-exchange layers** that limit Cl⁻ access to the active surface.                                                                                                                             |
| **Universal 40 min polarity-reversal (PR) cycle**                  | Oxide (claim) vs. Kinetic Monte-Carlo prediction for Zn-rich spinels needing > 60 min | Experimental PR of 40 min restores activity for many spinels; simulations suggest slower vacancy replenishment for low-conductivity compositions.                        | PR duration must be **material-specific**. For high-conductivity Ti₄O₇-based systems 40 min suffices, whereas ZnFe₂O₄ or other low-mobility oxides require longer cathodic periods. A practical guideline: **monitor O-vacancy density in-situ (e.g., via operando XAS) to adapt PR timing dynamically**.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **ALD Al₂O₃ coating blocks ROS** vs. Permeable protection (≤ 5 nm) | MXene (claim) vs. Counter-statement (permeable)                                       | Early reports indicated loss of activity after thick Al₂O₃; subsequent work with ultrathin (2–5 nm) layers retained > 80 % •OH generation.                               | The contradiction is **thickness-dependent**. Sub-nanometer ALD layers act as **porous barriers** that allow water/ROS diffusion while preventing MXene oxidation. The design rule: **limit ALD thickness to ≤ 5 nm and verify permeability via water-vapor sorption or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy**.                                                                                                                                                         |

Overall, contradictions arise from **differences in experimental conditions (electrolyte composition, PFAS concentration, flow regime), material synthesis nuances (defect density, dopant distribution, coating thickness), and measurement techniques (ex-situ vs. operando).** By recognising these variables, the community can converge on unified performance metrics and standardised testing protocols. Reporting paired metrics—TOC removal and fluoride release—together with inorganic by-product profiles under matched matrices will further reduce interpretation gaps.

## 4. Unique Perspective Insights

### 4.1 Heteroatom-Doped Carbon Electrodes

* **Machine-Learning-Guided Discovery** – The integration of RF, XGBoost, and GNN models enables rapid virtual screening of > 10⁴ dopant configurations, dramatically shortening the experimental cycle.
* **Synergistic Co-Doping** – Binary/ternary dopant pairs create **adjacent electron-rich/electron-deficient sites** that simultaneously enhance PFAS adsorption and lower C–F activation barriers, a phenomenon not observed in single-dopant systems.
* **Microporosity-Driven Mass Transport** – Pore sizes tuned to 0.5–1 nm provide a “molecular-sieving” effect that concentrates PFAS while limiting diffusion of bulk water and co-adsorbed natural organic matter, thereby increasing local ROS concentration.

### 4.2 Transition-Metal Oxide / Spinel Electrodes

* **Oxygen-Vacancy as a Catalytic Hub** – Surface O-vacancies act as *in-situ* ROS generators; their formation energy serves as a quantitative predictor of catalytic activity across diverse oxides.
* **Polarity-Reversal Regeneration** – PR cycles constitute a **self-healing strategy** that restores vacancy populations without chemical additives, offering a low-maintenance pathway for long-term operation.
* **Magnéli/Spinel Composite Monoliths** – Intergrown Ti₄O₇-Mn₃O₄ structures combine the **high conductivity of Magnéli phases** with the **robust redox chemistry of spinels**, delivering performance comparable to noble-metal anodes but at a fraction of the cost.

### 4.3 MXene / Boron-Nitride Hybrid Platforms

* **Electro-Photo-Catalytic Duality** – By coupling **electro-chemical bias** with **visible-light excitation**, MXene/BN hybrids exploit both *direct electron transfer* and *ROS-mediated* pathways, achieving high activity at lower potentials.
* **Surface-Termination Engineering** – The deliberate balance of –OH and –O groups tailors both **adsorption affinity** and **band-edge positions**, providing a versatile knob absent in conventional carbon or oxide electrodes.
* **Scalable 3-D Architectures** – Vacuum-filtered laminates and foams can be produced in kilogram batches, demonstrating that high-performance MXene-based electrodes are **manufacturable** for pilot-scale treatment plants with uniform thickness and low contact resistance across laminates.

Each perspective contributes a **distinct mechanistic lever** (heteroatom electronic modulation, vacancy-driven ROS, mixed-termination photophysics) that, when combined, can address the full spectrum of PFAS challenges—from strong adsorption of diverse chain lengths to sustained ROS production in halide-rich waters.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The multi-perspective synthesis reveals that **no single material class alone solves every PFAS-remediation challenge**, but each offers complementary strengths that can be merged into next-generation hybrid electrodes.

1. **Materials capable of high mineralisation and defluorination under ambient conditions** (near-neutral pH and moderate salinity) include:

   * **Co-doped heteroatom-rich microporous carbons** (N,S, N,B, N,P) that deliver > 90 % TOC removal and > 75 % fluoride release at low cell potentials.
   * **Oxygen-vacancy-engineered transition-metal oxides/spinels**, especially **Ti₄O₇-Mn₃O₄ composite monoliths**, which achieve > 90 % mineralisation and > 75 % defluorination at ≤ 2 V with excellent halide tolerance, provided chlorate/perchlorate formation is monitored and suppressed.
   * **MXene/BN heterojunctions** with mixed –OH/–O terminations and ultrathin ALD protection, which combine **high adsorption (K_d ≥ 10⁴ M⁻¹)**, **photo-enhanced ROS generation (≈ 1.8 mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻²) under visible-light assistance**, and **scalable 3-D architectures**.

2. **Intrinsic properties to optimise** – The unified descriptor set (ΔG₍ads₎, Eₐ C–F, ROS rate, conductivity, structural stability) provides a quantitative roadmap for rational design. Materials should be engineered to simultaneously satisfy strong yet reversible PFAS adsorption, low C–F activation barriers (via electronic or vacancy effects), and high ROS flux at modest potentials, and should be benchmarked against standard probe assays and reference PFAS cocktails.

3. **Guidelines for discovery** –

   * **Atomic-scale heteroatom pairing** (N with S/B/P) for carbon frameworks.
   * **Targeted oxygen-vacancy creation** (Eᵥᴏ ≈ 1 eV) and **material-specific polarity-reversal timing** for oxides.
   * **Mixed surface terminations** and **type-II heterojunctions** for MXene/BN systems, complemented by **ultrathin ALD protection** to ensure long-term stability.

4. **Strategic integration** – Hybrid electrodes that combine **carbon-based dopant sites with metal-oxide vacancy centres** (e.g., N-doped MXene-supported spinel nanoparticles), integrated within electrically percolating frameworks, are poised to surpass the performance of any single class, delivering **> 95 % mineralisation and > 80 % defluorination** for complex PFAS mixtures at low energy cost (< 0.5 kWh m⁻³).

The multi-perspective approach has clarified that **efficient PFAS electro-oxidation is a balance of adsorption, electronic activation, and ROS supply**, each of which can be tuned through distinct yet compatible material strategies. Future research should focus on **integrated electrode architectures** that embed the best attributes of each branch, validated by operando spectroscopies and benchmarked against standardized PFAS cocktails. Matrix effects from bicarbonate, chloride, and natural organic matter should be explicitly quantified during optimisation.
