## 1. Introduction

Perovskite–silicon tandem cells, organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and quantum-dot solar cells (QDSCs) dominate the current landscape of next-generation photovoltaics (PV).  Their rapid progress—record efficiencies above 30 % for tandem architectures, laboratory PCEs ~20 % for OPVs, and > 20 % for QDSCs—has spurred intense research into alternative absorber classes and device concepts that could push the limits of efficiency, durability, and manufacturability.

Beyond the established platforms, three unconventional material families and device architectures have emerged as particularly promising:

| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ferroelectric bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE)** | BiFeO₃, Ba₀.₆Sr₀.₄TiO₃, 1T′-MoTe₂, ferroelectric polymers (PVDF-TrFE) | Ultra-high open-circuit voltages (V_oc > 3 V) driven by domain-wall (DW) engineering and strain/flexoelectric coupling.                                                     |

The present report synthesizes three independent research branches that investigate these unconventional PV concepts.  Each branch offers a distinct perspective—ferroelectric BPVE, 2-D heterostructure photovoltaics, and chalcogenide perovskite tandems—yet they converge on common themes of **high-voltage generation, strain-mediated band engineering, and the need for scalable, defect-free fabrication**.  The goal is to evaluate which of these material classes or device architectures holds the most unexpected promise for breakthroughs in efficiency, stability, and scalability.

# 2. Synthesized Findings

## 2.1 Ferroelectric Bulk Photovoltaic Effect (BPVE)

* **Ultra-high V_oc**: Domain-wall engineering in ferroelectric oxides yields V_oc > 1 V, with single-crystal BiFeO₃ exhibiting exceptionally large photovoltages across millimeter-scale samples under strong illumination.  The BPVE coefficient β can be amplified by roughly an order of magnitude with 0.1–3 % strain, and flexoelectric fields from strain gradients further enhance the internal field.
* **Domain-wall dominance**: Measurements attribute on the order of ~10–10² mV per wall (e.g., ~150 mV for some 109° walls and ~20 mV for 71° walls), with values sensitive to geometry and illumination.  The overall V_oc tends to scale approximately linearly with DW density in small-area devices.
* **Hybrid 2-D/3-D stacks**: Incorporating MoS₂/WSe₂ or BP/MoS₂ heterostructures improves carrier extraction, with reported responsivities > 10⁴ A W⁻¹ in photodetector mode and ~60 % PCE gains in select polymer bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices.
* **Scalability**: Sputtering and PLD have produced 4-inch BiFeO₃ wafers with ~1 % epitaxial compressive strain that preserves dense DW networks, but large-area, low-cost routes remain limited.

**Key take-away**: Ferroelectric BPVE can deliver record voltages, but power conversion efficiencies remain typically < 0.1 %, largely because J_sc is limited by recombination and modest absorption.  The main bottleneck is the conversion of the internal field into useful current without excessive recombination.

## 2.2 Van der Waals 2-D Heterostructure Photovoltaics

* **High-efficiency simulations**: First-principles-informed models of MoSi₂As₄/MoGe₂N₄ heterojunctions predict ~22 % PCE, with calculated room-temperature mobilities ≈ 9 k cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹ and absorption coefficients of 10⁵–10⁶ cm⁻¹.
* **Strain-tunable band alignment**: ±0.6 % biaxial strain in ZrSSe/HfSSe or 1–2 % strain in WS₂/ZnO can switch a type-I stack to type-II, boosting built-in fields and photocurrent by up to ~18× in selected systems (e.g., α-In₂Se₃/WSe₂).
* **Scalable fabrication**: Electrochemical exfoliation, liquid intercalation, and capillary-driven rolling have been explored for wafer-scale vertical vdW arrays and proof-of-concept roll-up demonstrators approaching square-meter footprints.  However, experimental PCEs for modules > 0.1 m² are still missing.
* **Hybrid 2-D/3-D perovskite interfaces**: 2-D interlayers (MoS₂, h-BN) reduce perovskite hysteresis by > 50 % and enable > 20 % PCE with > 90 % efficiency recovery after 4 000 bending cycles in standardized flex tests.
* **Encapsulation**: 2-D barrier layers (h-BN, MoS₂, Al₂O₃/hBN nanolaminates) reduce water-vapour transmission rates by > 10⁴×, extending operational lifetimes beyond 10 000 h under 1 sun in accelerated aging.

**Key take-away**: 2-D heterostructures offer unprecedented flexibility and strain-tunable band engineering, but validated large-area module performance and long-term outdoor stability remain unverified.

## 2.3 Chalcogenide Perovskites as Tandem Top Cells

* **Band-gap tunability**: B-site alloying (e.g., Zr/Hf/Ti) and S/Se mixed-anion chemistry tune the band gap between ~1.4–2.1 eV, enabling more precise current matching with Si, CZTSSe, or perovskite bottom cells.  Simulations predict > 30 % tandem efficiency; experimental demonstrations reach > 20 % (4-terminal or simulated).
* **Defect tolerance & high absorption**: BaZrS₃, SrZrSe₃, BaHfS₃, and CaZrS₃ exhibit absorption > 10⁵ cm⁻¹ and can be processed at ≤ 600 °C in some routes, compatible with low-temperature perovskite or silicon layers.
* **Interface engineering**: h-BN, graphene, TiO₂/CPs, and Cu₂Te back-surface fields suppress interfacial recombination; reported transparent electrodes achieve sheet resistance ≤ 40 Ω sq⁻¹ with > 90 % transmittance using GQD-doped SnO₂ + GO/rGO + MXene composites.
* **Scalable deposition**: Gas-source MBE, ALD, MOVPE, sputtering, and solution-processed inks have produced pinhole-free films ranging from textured polycrystalline to epitaxial layers.  Large-area (≥ 100 cm²) roll-to-roll processes remain to be commercialized.
* **Stability**: Encapsulated devices retain > 95 % of initial PCE after 1 000 h (ambient) or 2 200 h (N₂) under accelerated protocols, but long-term (> 5 yr) data and thermal-cycling performance are missing.

**Key take-away**: Chalcogenide perovskites offer a promising, low-temperature top-cell platform with excellent band-gap tunability, but experimentally validated two-terminal monolithic tandems and long-term stability data are still lacking.

# 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution

| **Contradiction**                    | **Source 1**                                                                              | **Source 2**                                                                                                        | **Possible Resolution**                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain walls vs. bulk BPVE**       | “Domain walls are the sole source of ultra-high V_oc.”                                    | “Bulk BPVE still contributes significantly; intrinsic BPVE coefficient can reach 0.5 V⁻¹ without DWs.”              | Both mechanisms coexist; in highly engineered DW networks the BPVE is dominated by DWs, but in pristine or 2-D ferroelectrics the bulk contribution can be non-negligible.                            |
| **Strain engineering benefits**      | “Strain alone can raise V_oc > 3 V while maintaining high J_sc.”                          | “Strain improves V_oc but often reduces J_sc due to increased recombination.”                                       | Strain engineering must be coupled with defect-passivation strategies; the net effect depends on the material’s defect tolerance and the strain magnitude.                                            |
| **Flexoelectric scalability**        | “Flexoelectric coupling is a scalable, low-cost route.”                                   | “Flexoelectric fields require precise strain gradients difficult to maintain over wafer-scale devices.”             | Flexoelectricity may be viable in micro- or nano-structured devices where strain gradients are naturally present, but wafer-scale implementation requires novel patterning or substrate engineering.  |
| **Hybrid 2-D/3-D tandem efficiency** | “Hybrid 2-D/3-D perovskite interfaces reduce hysteresis by > 50 % and enable > 20 % PCE.” | “Hybrid interfaces alone do not guarantee higher efficiency; hysteresis reduction does not translate to PCE gains.” | Hysteresis reduction is necessary but not sufficient; additional factors such as interfacial recombination, charge-transport layers, and series resistance must also be optimized.                    |
| **Large-area module performance**    | “Roll-up modules > 1 m² can be fabricated with > 90 % yield.”                             | “Experimental PCEs for modules > 0.1 m² are missing.”                                                               | Yield and fabrication feasibility are distinct from device performance; achieving high yield does not automatically translate to high PCE, which requires uniform film quality and interface control. |

**Why the contradictions persist**:

* **Measurement disparities**: Many studies report idealized or simulated efficiencies, while experimental data often lag due to fabrication challenges.
* **Material heterogeneity**: Ferroelectric oxides and 2-D heterostructures exhibit strong dependence on domain configuration, strain state, and defect density, leading to variable results across labs.
* **Scale-up gaps**: Techniques that work on the wafer or sub-cm² scale (e.g., PLD, MBE) may not translate directly to roll-to-roll or printing processes, creating a disconnect between reported performance and practical scalability.

# 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The comparative analysis of ferroelectric BPVE, 2-D heterostructure photovoltaics, and chalcogenide perovskite tandems reveals a common thread: **the exploitation of internal fields—whether from domain walls, strain-induced band offsets, or built-in ferroelectric potentials—can generate exceptionally high open-circuit voltages in small-area or model devices**.  However, translating these high voltages into practical, high-efficiency devices requires overcoming several intertwined challenges:

1. **Photocurrent Generation**: Ferroelectric BPVE devices suffer from low J_sc due to recombination and limited absorption.  Enhancing carrier extraction through hybrid 2-D/3-D stacks or engineered nanostructures is essential.
2. **Scalable Fabrication**: 2-D heterostructures and chalcogenide perovskites have demonstrated promising small-scale efficiencies, but large-area module performance remains unverified.  Roll-to-roll, printing, and solution-processing techniques must be refined to maintain uniformity and defect control.
3. **Stability Under Real-World Conditions**: Encapsulation strategies (h-BN, Al₂O₃/hBN nanolaminates) show promise, yet long-term outdoor degradation data (> 5 yr) are still missing for all three classes.  Mechanical fatigue, thermal cycling, and environmental exposure under field-relevant spectra and temperature swings must be systematically studied.
4. **Integration with Existing PV Architectures**: Chalcogenide perovskites offer a clear path to low-temperature tandem integration with silicon or perovskite bottom cells, but two-terminal monolithic tandem devices have yet to be experimentally realized.  Ferroelectric BPVE could be integrated as a high-voltage top cell, while 2-D heterostructures could serve as intermediate layers or flexible interconnects.

**Which unconventional material class offers the most unexpected promise?**

* **Chalcogenide perovskites** stand out for their **band-gap tunability, defect tolerance, and low-temperature processability**, making them the most viable candidate for next-generation tandem top cells.  Their compatibility with silicon and perovskite bottom layers, combined with the potential for scalable deposition, positions them as a strong contender for commercial deployment, pending monolithic demonstrations at scale.
* **Ferroelectric BPVE** offers the most **unprecedented open-circuit voltages**, but the current efficiency ceiling (< 0.1 %) and scalability hurdles limit immediate impact.  Continued research into domain-wall engineering, strain-gradient control, and hybrid architectures could unlock higher efficiencies.
* **2-D heterostructures** provide **flexibility, strain-tunable band alignment, and the possibility of ultra-thin, lightweight modules**, but the lack of large-area performance data and the need for precise layer stacking and interfacial cleanliness control temper their near-term commercial prospects.

In conclusion, a **synergistic approach**—combining the high-voltage potential of ferroelectric BPVE, the strain-engineering flexibility of 2-D heterostructures, and the defect-tolerant, tunable absorbers of chalcogenide perovskites—could pave the way for breakthrough efficiencies, robust stability, and scalable manufacturing in next-generation photovoltaics.
