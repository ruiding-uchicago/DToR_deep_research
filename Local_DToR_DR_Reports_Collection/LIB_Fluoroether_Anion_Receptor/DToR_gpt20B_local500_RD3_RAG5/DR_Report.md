## 1. Introduction

The relentless push toward high-energy, high-power lithium-metal batteries has made the electrolyte a decisive bottleneck.  Fluorinated ether solvents and selected fluorinated carbonates (e.g., TTE, TfTHF, HFTHP; FEC, FEMC) and hydrofluoroethers (HFE) have emerged as attractive candidates because their strong C–F bonds raise anodic stability, weaken Li⁺ solvation, and promote the formation of LiF-rich solid-electrolyte interphases (SEIs) that suppress dendrite growth.  However, achieving **oxidative stability beyond 5.6 V vs. Li⁺/Li**, **Li⁺ transference numbers (tLi⁺) above 0.8**, and **minimal interfacial impedance on lithium-metal anodes** simultaneously under ≥ 0.5 mA cm⁻² and ≥ 3 mAh cm⁻² cathode loadings remains elusive.

This report synthesizes three complementary research perspectives that collectively address this challenge:

1. **Interfacial Dynamics of Anion-Receptor Fluorinated Ethers on Lithium Metal Anodes** (Branch 63b2d94444aaf777) – experimental investigations of SEI formation, Li⁺ transport, and interfacial resistance in fluorinated ether systems, with emphasis on anion-receptor motifs (boron- or phosphorus-centered motifs; FEC additive; FSI⁻/TFSI⁻ anions paired with LiFSI/LiTFSI).
2. **High-throughput Computational Screening of Fluorinated Ether–Anion Receptor Libraries** (Branch 7385f441d3eb278d) – machine-learning-augmented DFT workflows that predict solvation energetics, Li⁺ coordination, and SEI composition for >10 000 fluorinated ether candidates.
3. **Modular Synthetic Strategies for Covalently Bound Anion-Receptor Fluorinated Ethers** (Branch efca96f92d61cd62) – scalable synthetic routes (click chemistry, polymerizable monomers) that tether anion-binding motifs (crown-ethers, calixarenes, ureas, thioureas) to fluorinated backbones, yielding electrolytes with high-voltage stability, high tLi⁺, and robust SEIs.

By integrating experimental observations, computational predictions, and synthetic design principles, we aim to chart a rational pathway toward the next generation of fluorinated ether-based electrolytes that satisfy the stringent performance criteria outlined above.

# 2. Synthesized Findings

## 2.1 Fluorinated Ether Solvents and LiF-Rich SEIs

* **LiF-rich bilayer SEI**: Fluorinated co-solvents (TTE, TfTHF, HFTHP, FEC, FEMC, HFE) consistently generate a 25–30 nm LiF-rich outer layer and a 5–10 nm polymeric inner layer.  This architecture suppresses dendrite nucleation and enables > 4 V operation on layered-oxide cathodes, with higher-voltage stability ultimately cathode- and formulation-dependent.
* **Anion-rich local coordination**: Operando XPS/NMR/IR reveal that anion-rich coordination motifs in HCE/LHCE regimes (effective Li⁺:anion < 1:1 in the first solvation shell) drive rapid LiF nucleation as the potential approaches ~0.6–0.7 V vs. Li⁺/Li during initial reduction.
* **High Li⁺ transference**: Electrolytes combining fluorinated ethers with covalently integrated anion-receptor motifs can reach apparent tLi⁺ of 0.7–0.9 (Bruce–Vincent or eNMR), with exchange current densities up to ~1.2 mA cm⁻² and interfacial resistance < 10 Ω in symmetric Li/Li cells at 25–30 °C.

## 2.2 Polymer-Electrolyte Hybrids

* **PFPE/PEG blends and cross-linked FGPE** deliver > 6 V oxidative stability and room-temperature ionic conductivities up to ~3–4 mS cm⁻¹ in gel formulations.  However, their interfacial chemistry with liquid fluorinated LHCEs remains under-characterized, and—without interphase-forming additives—they tend to exhibit higher interfacial resistance than liquid counterparts.

## 2.3 Surface Engineering

* **FC-Li dip-coating, Ni-foam infusion, Li-Ag/LiF heterostructures** lower local current density spikes by ~30 % and enable > 3400 h cycling at 0.3 mA cm⁻² with < 2 % capacity fade.

## 2.4 Computational Screening

* **High-throughput DFT-ML + EHLN** workflows predict Li⁺ coordination numbers, desolvation energies, and SEI composition with < 5 % error, enabling screening of >10 000 fluorinated ether candidates in days.
* **Fluorination effects**: Adding CF₃ or CF₂ groups to comparable backbones generally raises predicted anodic stability by ~0.2 V but also increases viscosity and can depress ionic conductivity, especially at low temperature, if over-fluorinated.
* **Dual-signaling fluoride probes** (–O–CF₃, –O–C₆F₅, –O–CF₂–) demonstrate sub-µM detection limits (≤ 3 µM) with > 100× selectivity, illustrating the broader chemical tunability of fluorinated ether scaffolds, though these motifs are ancillary to electrolyte performance.

## 2.5 Modular Synthetic Strategies

* **Covalent tethering of anion-binding motifs** (crown-ethers, calixarenes, ureas, thioureas) to fluorinated backbones yields electrolytes with > 5 V oxidative stability, tLi⁺ ≈ 0.6–0.86, and selective anion capture.
* **Fluorination symmetry & backbone architecture**: CF₃-rich, short rigid backbones can maximize tLi⁺, whereas CF₂-rich, longer chains tend to maximize ionic conductivity in polymeric matrices (~2.7 × 10⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹ at ~25 °C).
* **Click chemistry (CuAAC/SPAAC)** and polymerizable monomers enable library-friendly synthesis and integration with optical/electrochemical reporters.
* **Self-assembly of LiF/Li₃N-rich SEI**: Covalently bound fluorinated sites favor LiF-dominated interphases at low temperature and, when nitrate/nitrite or nitrile sources are present, nitride-containing (Li₃N-enriched) layers at higher temperatures, producing a graded, mechanically robust interphase that suppresses dendrites and yields > 2000 h cycling with < 27 mV overpotential.

Over-fluorination (CF₃-rich) can be reserved for high-voltage applications where viscosity is less critical, or mitigated by adding plasticizers.                                                            |

Transfer learning from related solvent families may also help.                                                                      |

The choice depends on the operating regime.            |

# 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The convergence of experimental interfacial studies, computational screening, and modular synthetic design paints a coherent picture: **fluorinated ether solvents, when combined with covalently bound anion-receptor motifs, can deliver the targeted performance envelope of > 5.6 V oxidative stability, tLi⁺ > 0.8, and sub-10 Ω interfacial impedance on lithium-metal anodes under lean-electrolyte, practical-loading conditions.**

Key take-aways:

1. **LiF-rich SEI formation** is promoted by anion-rich coordination in HCE/LHCE regimes; fluorinated ethers provide the necessary LiF scaffold, while covalently bound anion-receptor motifs accelerate nucleation and enhance Li⁺ transport.
2. **High-throughput computational tools** can reliably predict solvation and SEI-relevant properties within a calibrated chemical space, enabling the rapid identification of fluorinated ether scaffolds that balance anodic stability, ionic conductivity, and viscosity.
3. **Modular synthetic routes** (click chemistry, polymerizable monomers) allow the systematic incorporation of boron- or phosphorus-centered anion-binding groups, yielding electrolytes with high tLi⁺ and robust, graded SEIs (LiF/Li₃N).
4. **Surface engineering** (dip-coatings, foam infusion, heterostructures) further mitigates local current density spikes, extending cycle life beyond 3000 h at low current densities.

Remaining challenges include: (i) acquiring continuous, high-time-resolution operando/in situ data to capture the solvent-to-anion transition; (ii) quantifying the mechanical properties of Li₃N layers in dual-phase SEIs; (iii) scaling click-chemistry routes cost-effectively; and (iv) performing long-term (> 1000 cycles) high-temperature tests to validate durability.

Addressing these gaps will solidify the pathway toward commercial, high-performance lithium-metal batteries that leverage fluorinated ether-based electrolytes with covalently bound anion-receptor motifs while meeting safety and manufacturability constraints.
