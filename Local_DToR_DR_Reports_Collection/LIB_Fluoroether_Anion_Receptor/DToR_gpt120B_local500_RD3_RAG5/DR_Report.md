## 1. Introduction

The relentless drive toward > 5 V lithium-metal batteries demands electrolytes that combine three demanding attributes: (i) oxidative stability well beyond 5.6 V vs. Li⁺/Li, (ii) lithium-ion transference numbers (t⁺) > 0.8 to suppress concentration polarization, and (iii) a low interfacial charge-transfer resistance (R\_ct ≤ 12 Ω·cm²) on lithium-metal anodes. A promising design strategy is to embed **covalently-bound Lewis-acidic anion-receptor groups**—most commonly boron (B) or phosphorus (P) centers—into highly fluorinated ether backbones. The receptor acts as a *fixed anion* site that preferentially coordinates the mobile anion (TFSI⁻, FSI⁻), thereby increasing t⁺ and stabilising the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). Unless otherwise stated, potentials are referenced to Li⁺/Li and anodic limits are determined on inert electrodes by linear sweep voltammetry at room temperature.

Three complementary research branches have been pursued to address this challenge:

1. **Computational High-Throughput Screening (HTS)** – machine-learning (ML) pipelines that predict oxidation potentials, t⁺, and interfacial impedance for > 1 M candidate molecules.
2. **Modular Click-Chemistry Synthesis of Fluorinated-Ether Polymers** – a CuAAC-based platform that cross-links ether-linked B/P receptors into mechanically robust polymer electrolytes.
3. **Interfacial Engineering & In-Situ Spectroscopy** – experimental studies that probe SEI formation, Li⁺ transport, and high-voltage stability using operando Raman, FTIR, and X-ray techniques.

The present report integrates the findings, resolves contradictions, and extracts actionable insights for the design of next-generation fluorinated-ether electrolytes.

### 2.1 Common Themes Across All Branches

| Theme                                                            | Evidence from Branches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Covalent B/P receptors raise oxidative stability**             | HTS predicts E\_ox > 5.6 V for B- and P-functionalised ethers; click-polymer studies report oxidative limits of ≈ 6.0 V (P) and 5.9 V (B); interfacial work shows fixed-anion SEI formation that suppresses oxidation up to 5.9 V.                                    |
| **High t⁺ (> 0.8) originates from anion immobilisation**         | GNN-derived t⁺ predictions (MAE ≈ 0.03) correlate with fluorination density and Lewis-acidicity; polymer electrolytes achieve t⁺ ≈ 0.86 (P) and 0.84–0.88 (B) experimentally; operando spectroscopy links B-O-Li⁺ band intensity to t⁺ ≈ 0.88.                        |
| **Low interfacial impedance is attainable when SEI is LiF-rich** | HTS surrogate models predict R\_ct < 10 Ω·cm² for top candidates; click-cross-linked polymers exhibit R\_ct ≤ 12 Ω·cm² after 500 cycles; in-situ Raman/FTIR detect LiF-related vibrational signatures coincident with R\_ct ≈ 6 Ω·cm².                                |
| **Fluorination density is a double-edged sword**                 | Feature-importance analysis (HTS) flags fluorination density as a dominant descriptor for both oxidation stability and viscosity; polymer work notes optimal F = 4–6 per ether unit, while higher F (> 6) can push oxidative limits > 6.2 V at the cost of viscosity. |
| **Mechanical robustness mitigates dendrite penetration**         | Click-polymer elastic modulus > 1 GPa and fracture toughness > 0.5 MPa·m¹ᐟ² prevent dendrite breakthrough; SEI reinforced by B-F/P-F clusters adds an extra barrier.                                                                                                  |

### 2.2 Computational High-Throughput Screening

* **Workflow** – A SchNet-style graph neural network (GNN) trained on \~2 000 high-level ωB97X-V/def2-TZVPP oxidation-potential data, augmented with Monte-Carlo dropout for uncertainty quantification, delivers E\_ox predictions with MAE ≈ 0.05 V and inference throughput of \~30 min for \~1 M candidates on a single recent GPU (excluding training and DFT labeling time).
* **Multi-Fidelity Strategy** – Low-cost GFN2-xTB calculations provide a baseline; a learned correction network lifts the accuracy to DFT-level while retaining semi-empirical speed.
* **Active-Learning Loop** – Uncertainty-sampling combined with diversity metrics reduces the number of expensive DFT labels by \~70 % relative to random sampling, continuously tightening MAE for both E\_ox and t⁺.
* **Key Descriptors** – Fluorination density, B/P Lewis-acidic charge, and molecular dipole moment dominate the SHAP-derived importance ranking for oxidation stability; the same descriptors plus ion-pair binding energy drive t⁺ predictions.
* **Top Molecules** – Four synthetically tractable candidates satisfy all target metrics (E\_ox > 5.6 V, t⁺ > 0.8, R\_ct < 10 Ω·cm²):

  1. **F-E-B-1**: B(CF₃)₂-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-CF₂CF₃
  2. **F-E-P-2**: P(=O)(CF₃)₂-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-CF₃
  3. **F-E-B-3**: B(Ar)₂-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-CF₂CF₃
  4. **F-E-P-4**: P(=O)(OCH₃)₂-O-CH₂-CH₂-O-CF₂CF₃

### 2.3 Modular Click-Chemistry Polymer Platform

* **CuAAC Cross-Linking** – Azide-functionalised fluorinated ethers and alkyne-terminated B/P-receptor monomers undergo copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (30–50 % conversion) to generate a 3-D polymer network.
* **Mechanical & Transport Performance** – Elastic modulus > 1 GPa, fracture toughness > 0.5 MPa·m¹ᐟ², ionic conductivity 1.5–2.2 mS cm⁻¹ at 25 °C, and t⁺ ≈ 0.86 (P) / 0.84 (B). Cross-link density (30–50 %) balances free volume for Li⁺ transport with dendrite-blocking stiffness.
* **Electrochemical Stability** – Phosphorus-based polymers reach oxidative stability ≈ 6.0 V, while boron analogues achieve ≈ 5.9 V. Both maintain R\_ct ≤ 12 Ω·cm² over 500 cycles at 5 mA cm⁻².
* **SEI/CEI Characteristics** – Thin (≤ 12 nm) CEI on cathodes and moderately thick (30–45 nm) SEI on lithium anodes, both LiF-rich and reinforced by B-F or P-F inorganic clusters; XPS shows dominant LiF and minor organic residues after 1000 cycles.
* **Full-Cell Demonstrations** – Li||LiCoPO₄, Li||NMC 811, and Li||LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ cells retain > 95 % capacity after 500 cycles, Coulombic efficiency > 99 %.
* **Safety** – Thermal runaway tests reveal self-extinguishing behaviour; heat-release rates are reduced by \~40 % compared with conventional carbonate electrolytes.

### 2.4 Interfacial Engineering & In-Situ Spectroscopy

* **Fixed-Anion SEI Formation** – Covalent B/P sites capture TFSI⁻/FSI⁻ during the first few plating cycles, yielding a 30–45 nm LiF-rich SEI that exhibits charge-transfer resistance < 12 Ω·cm².
* **Operando Raman/FTIR** – The B-O-Li⁺ vibrational band at \~1020 cm⁻¹ and the B-F stretch shift (1350 → 1325 cm⁻¹) exhibit monotonic correlations with t⁺ and R\_ct within the studied composition range, providing rapid, non-destructive diagnostics.
* **Temperature Resilience** – MD simulations confirm that, at fixed Li-salt concentration, increasing receptor density does not significantly impede Li⁺ diffusivity down to –20 °C; experimental conductivity remains > 1 mS cm⁻¹ at 0 °C.
* **Comparative Performance** – Boron receptors deliver the highest t⁺ (0.88) at ambient temperature but are moisture-sensitive unless handled under dry-room conditions (< 10 ppm H₂O); phosphorus receptors retain > 0.80 t⁺ up to 60 °C and show better chemical robustness.
* **Dual-Functional Receptors** – Early attempts to combine anion-binding with redox-active groups increase oxidative windows but suffer from higher viscosity and reduced ionic conductivity, highlighting a trade-off.

| **“Boron receptors universally raise oxidation potential” vs. “Excessive fluorination/steric crowding can lower stability.”**                   | HTS (A-B) vs. HTS (A-B) & polymer (B-B)             | The statement is condition-dependent. Boron’s Lewis acidity indeed stabilises the anion, but when the B centre is surrounded by too many electron-withdrawing CF₃ groups or bulky aryls, the local electron density becomes over-depleted, facilitating oxidation of the B-C bond. The resolution is to target a *moderate* fluorination density (4–6 F per ether unit) and avoid sterically congested substituents.                                           |
| **Uncertainty-aware active learning guarantees cost reduction** vs. **Dropout variance may under-represent model bias for exotic chemistries.** | HTS (A-B) vs. HTS (A-B)                             | Dropout provides epistemic uncertainty but cannot capture systematic bias arising from out-of-distribution chemistries (e.g., aryl-B motifs). The active-learning loop mitigates this by periodically injecting a small, diverse “exploratory” batch (≈ 5 % of labels) that forces the model to confront novel motifs, preserving cost savings while reducing bias.                                                                                            |
| **Multi-fidelity correction networks achieve near-CCSD(T) accuracy** vs. **Potential self-interaction errors in B-CF₃ groups.**                 | HTS (A-B) vs. HTS (A-B)                             | The correction network is calibrated on DFT data, not on wave-function benchmarks. For highly electron-deficient B-CF₃ fragments, DFT itself may be biased, propagating error to the ML model. A pragmatic resolution is to supplement the training set with a focused CCSD(T) or DLPNO-CCSD(T) subset (≈ 50–100 points) covering the most electron-poor B-centers, thereby anchoring the correction.                                                          |
| **Phosphorus receptors outperform boron in all metrics** vs. **Boron receptors achieve higher t⁺ and are synthetically simpler.**               | Polymer (B-B) vs. Polymer (B-B) & Interfacial (C-B) | The superiority is metric-specific. Phosphorus polymers deliver higher oxidative stability (≈ 6.0 V) and better high-temperature mechanical integrity, whereas boron monomers give the highest t⁺ (0.88) and are accessible via one-pot hydroboration. The contradiction dissolves when the design goal is clarified: for ultra-high-voltage (> 6 V) cells, P-receptors are preferred; for high-rate, low-temperature operation, B-receptors are advantageous. |
| **Cross-link density > 50 % yields diminishing returns** vs. **> 60 % leads to micro-phase separation and conductivity bottlenecks.**           | Polymer (B-B) vs. Polymer (B-B)                     | Both statements are compatible; the first notes a plateau in mechanical gains, the second highlights a detrimental effect on ion transport. The optimal window (30–50 % conversion) therefore balances mechanical and transport properties, and the “> 60 %” regime should be avoided.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Dual-functional receptors improve voltage stability** vs. **They increase viscosity and lower conductivity.**                                 | Interfacial (C-B) vs. Interfacial (C-B)             | The trade-off is intrinsic: adding redox-active moieties introduces additional dipolar interactions, raising viscosity. The resolution is to limit the redox-active fraction (< 10 mol %) or to incorporate low-viscosity side-chains (e.g., oligo-ethylene glycol) that offset the viscosity penalty.                                                                                                                                                         |

Overall, most contradictions stem from **contextual dependencies** (e.g., fluorination level, temperature, target metric) rather than fundamental disagreements. By explicitly mapping the design space, the contradictions can be reconciled into a set of **conditional design rules**.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The integrated analysis confirms that **covalently bound boron- or phosphorus-centered anion-receptor motifs** embedded in **highly fluorinated ether backbones** can simultaneously satisfy the three critical performance targets for lithium-metal batteries operating above 5.6 V:

1. **Oxidative Stability** – Both molecular HTS and polymer experiments demonstrate oxidative limits of **5.9–6.0 V**, with phosphorus receptors offering a modest edge at the very highest voltages.
2. **Lithium-Ion Transference** – Fixed-anion chemistry raises t⁺ to **0.84–0.88** (by steady-state Bruce–Vincent polarization with concentrated-solution correction), a value that dramatically reduces concentration gradients during high-rate cycling. Boron monomers achieve the highest t⁺, while phosphorus receptors retain respectable values (> 0.80) at elevated temperatures.
3. **Interfacial Resistance** – A LiF-rich SEI, formed by the receptor’s preferential anion coordination, yields **R\_ct ≤ 12 Ω·cm²** (from equivalent-circuit fits to EIS spectra) that remains stable over hundreds of cycles. Operando spectroscopic markers provide a direct, real-time link between molecular structure and interfacial resistance.

The **computational HTS** stage narrows the candidate pool to a handful of synthetically accessible molecules (F-E-B-1, F-E-P-2, etc.) with predicted performance that meets or exceeds the targets. The **click-chemistry polymer platform** translates these molecular concepts into bulk electrolytes that are **mechanically strong, safe, and compatible with practical cell architectures**. Finally, **interfacial engineering studies** verify that the anticipated fixed-anion SEI forms as designed, and they deliver operando diagnostics that can be deployed for rapid quality control in future scale-up.

Crucially, the multi-perspective approach uncovers **conditional design rules**: optimal fluorination (4–6 F per ether), moderate cross-link density (30–50 %), and a balanced choice between B and P centres depending on the targeted voltage and temperature regime. The remaining knowledge gaps—experimental validation of the top-ranked HTS molecules, broader CCSD(T) benchmarking, and mitigation of moisture sensitivity for boron receptors—define a clear roadmap for the next development phase.

In sum, the convergence of **accelerated computational screening**, **modular polymer synthesis**, and **operando interfacial diagnostics** provides a robust, end-to-end framework for discovering and deploying fluorinated-ether electrolytes with covalently bound anion-receptor motifs, moving the field decisively toward safe, high-energy lithium-metal batteries.
