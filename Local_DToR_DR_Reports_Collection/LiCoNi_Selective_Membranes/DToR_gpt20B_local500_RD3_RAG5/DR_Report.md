**Integrated Research Report**
*Membrane Materials for Selective Separation of Li⁺, Co²⁺, and Ni²⁺ from Aqueous Solutions*  

---

### 1. Introduction  

The growing demand for lithium‑ion batteries, coupled with the scarcity of lithium resources, has intensified interest in efficient lithium recovery from brines, seawater, and industrial effluents. Simultaneously, cobalt and nickel—key cathode metals—must be reclaimed to reduce supply‑chain risks and environmental impacts. Membrane‑based separation offers a scalable, energy‑efficient route to isolate Li⁺, Co²⁺, and Ni²⁺ from complex aqueous matrices.  

Key to success is the exploitation of **selective transport properties**: (i) *tailored pore sizes* that discriminate ions by hydrated radius, (ii) *surface functionalizations* that provide specific binding or charge interactions, and (iii) *charge affinities* that favor cationic over anionic or multivalent species. The overarching design challenge is to **balance selectivity and permeability**—high rejection of undesired ions while maintaining sufficient flux for industrial throughput.  

The present report synthesizes three complementary research perspectives:

| Branch | Core Focus | Representative Materials | Design Emphasis |
|--------|------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Graphene Oxide (GO) / Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) composites with bio‑inspired ion channels | GO/LDH, GO/ZPDA, GO/PNIPAM | Dual‑gating (size + electrostatics), temperature/pressure responsiveness |
| 2 | Hybrid Polymer–MOF Mixed‑Matrix Membranes (MMMs) for size‑charge selectivity | MOF‑808, UiO‑66‑SO₃H, ZIF‑8, gradient MMMs | MOF loading, covalent tethering, ionic‑liquid functionalization |
| 3 | Ceramic Nanoporous Membranes with tunable surface charge and pore geometry | LLZAO–Li‑Nafion laminate, Fe₂O₃‑doped TiO₂, double‑helix LATP | Sub‑nanometer pores, negative surface charge, helical geometry |

By integrating these perspectives, we aim to identify **novel, effective, and practical membrane candidates** for Li⁺/Co²⁺/Ni²⁺ separation and to distill the design principles that optimize both selectivity and permeability.

### 2. Synthesized Findings  

#### 2.1 Dual‑Gating in GO/LDH Composites  

- **Vertical GO/LDH channels** exhibit ion conductance 200–300 × higher than horizontal GO, with low resistance (~10⁻² S cm⁻¹) and mechanical strength (~8.8 MPa).  
- **Size confinement** is achieved by GO interlayer spacing (3–6 Å), while **electrostatic discrimination** arises from positively charged LDH layers. This dual gating yields **Li⁺/Mg²⁺ selectivity > 10** and **K⁺/Na⁺ selectivity up to 15.2** even at high ionic strengths.  
- **Temperature tuning**: GO spacing expands ~0.1 Å °C⁻¹; surface charge shifts ~0.02 e °C⁻¹, allowing reversible modulation of selectivity (Li⁺/Na⁺ drops from ~10 at 25 °C to ~5 at 80 °C).  
- **Pressure‑ and pH‑responsive gating** (e.g., GO/ZPDA, GO/PNIPAM) can change permeability by > 30 % within seconds, enabling on‑demand Li⁺/Na⁺ separation cycles.  
- **Chemical stability**: > 90 % of initial flux after 3 days in 3 M NaOH or 1 M NaCl; > 95 % Na₂SO₄ rejection in 1000 mg L⁻¹ solutions.  
- **Scalable fabrication**: one‑pot hydrothermal, roll‑to‑roll electrodeposition, and spray‑coating routes produce kilogram‑scale sheets with thickness‑independent performance (up to 1 mm) and ~30 % lower cost than polymeric nanofiltration membranes.

#### 2.2 Hybrid Polymer–MOF MMMs  

- **High MOF loading (60–80 wt %)** in polymers (PIM‑1, PVDF‑HFP) yields CO₂/CH₄ selectivity > 30 and permeability 100–200 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹. For Li⁺/Na⁺, selectivity can reach ≈ 10 (MOF‑808 gradient) or > 1.2 (IL‑MOF TFN).  
- **Charge‑selective surface chemistry** (SO₃⁻, crown‑ether, fluorinated linkers, ILs) raises Li⁺ transference numbers to 0.5–0.86 and expands electrochemical windows to 5.2–5.8 V.  
- **Covalent tethering vs physical blending**: In‑situ polymerization or post‑synthetic tethering doubles ionic conductivity (4.3 × 10⁻⁵ S cm⁻¹ vs 2.1 × 10⁻⁵ S cm⁻¹) and reduces interfacial resistance, though absolute R_ct values remain unreported.  
- **Defect‑free interfaces**: Gradient‑distributed MOF layers and in‑situ growth eliminate voids, reducing swelling (< 5 % at 80 °C) and maintaining tensile strength > 50 MPa. Physical blends show ~12 % swelling and ~30 MPa strength.  
- **Scalable green synthesis**: Flow‑synthesis and mechanochemical routes achieve STY ≈ 10⁶ kg m⁻³ day⁻¹; solvent‑free MOF production is possible, but cost per m² remains higher than conventional polymeric membranes unless MOF loading is increased without selectivity loss.  
- **Long‑term durability**: MOF‑based electrodes retain > 90 % capacity after 10 000 cycles; MMMs are expected to sustain ≥ 10 000 separation cycles with < 5 % loss in selectivity, though real‑world fouling and chemical degradation data are sparse.

#### 2.3 Ceramic Nanoporous Membranes  

- **Sub‑nanometer pores (3–4 Å)** in ceramic frameworks (geopolymer, TiO₂‑based) give Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity ≈ 3–4; 1–5 nm pores yield 930‑fold Li⁺/Na⁺ discrimination in double‑helix LATP membranes.  
- **Surface‑charge density**: A negative charge density of –0.05 C m⁻² (COMSOL) or –0.10 C m⁻² (NEMD) boosts Li⁺ selectivity and lowers dehydration barriers.  
- **Helical geometry**: 1‑mm long double‑helix ceramic channels increase permeance by ~85 % (1200 → 3000 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹) and lower pressure drop by ~25 % compared with linear pores, while maintaining > 90 % of initial flux after 1000 h.  
- **Fouling mitigation**: Fe₂O₃ doping preserves flux and cuts fouling resistance by ~30 % (Barati 2023); magnetic Fe₃O₄ loading enables magnetic removal of deposits (Chen 2024).  
- **Ligand functionalisation**: Crown‑ether/cryptand grafting on ceramic supports (GO, polyether sulfone, chitosan) delivers Li⁺ uptake up to 297 mg g⁻¹ and > 90 % regeneration over five acid‑elution cycles.  
- **Composite laminates**: LLZAO–Li‑Nafion laminates achieve Li⁺ conductivity of 1.22 × 10⁻³ S cm⁻¹ (PC, 25 °C) and Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity ≥ 3–4, enabling stable LiFePO₄ half‑cell performance (140 mAh g⁻¹ after 50 cycles).

### 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution  

| Contradiction | Source | Possible Resolution |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|
| **GO/LDH selectivity > 10³ vs. < 5.6 Å claim** | Branch 1 | The > 10³ values were reported for idealized KCl/K₂SO₄ systems with 6.4–5.6 Å channels. In real brines, competing multivalent ions and higher ionic strength reduce selectivity. The discrepancy highlights the need for systematic studies across realistic feed compositions. |
| **Temperature cycling durability** | Branch 1 | While short‑term cycling (≤ 80 °C) shows no degradation, long‑term (> 10 000 h) data are missing. Thermal expansion of LDH layers could induce delamination; future work should monitor interlayer spacing over extended cycles. |
| **SHI‑treated GO swelling** | Branch 1 | SHI irradiation eliminates swelling but introduces defects that may accelerate fouling. The trade‑off between mechanical stability and fouling resistance requires further investigation. |
| **Covalent tethering interfacial resistance** | Branch 2 | No absolute R_ct values reported; the claim of reduced resistance remains qualitative. Direct impedance measurements on tethered MMMs are needed to quantify the benefit. |
| **MOF pore size > 1 nm still high selectivity** | Branch 2 | Some MOFs (e.g., CuBTC 0.82 nm) maintain high Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity due to additional polysulfide trapping or surface chemistry. This suggests that pore size alone is insufficient; surface functionalization and ion‑binding sites play a critical role. |
| **Ligand functionalisation on ceramics unverified** | Branch 3 | Claims of crown‑ether grafting on ceramic substrates lack experimental confirmation. Pilot studies should graft ligands onto ceramic supports and evaluate Li⁺ uptake and selectivity. |
| **Fe₂O₃ doping fouling reduction under all conditions** | Branch 3 | While Fe₂O₃ reduces fouling in laboratory tests, its efficacy in realistic brine (multivalent ions, organics) remains untested. Long‑term fouling studies are required. |

**Resolution Strategy**  
- **Standardised feed matrices**: Use synthetic brines that mimic real seawater or industrial effluents to benchmark selectivity.  
- **Long‑term cycling protocols**: Implement > 10 000 h pressure/temperature cycling with periodic flux/rejection measurements.  
- **Direct impedance measurements**: For MMMs, report absolute R_ct values to substantiate claims of interfacial resistance reduction.  
- **Ligand grafting trials**: Perform controlled grafting of crown‑ether/cryptand onto ceramic substrates and quantify Li⁺ uptake and selectivity.

### 5. Comprehensive Conclusion  

The integrated analysis reveals that **effective Li⁺/Co²⁺/Ni²⁺ separation** can be achieved by combining **size‑selective confinement** with **charge‑selective interactions** across a spectrum of membrane architectures:

1. **GO/LDH composites** excel in **dual‑gating** and **responsive tuning**, offering high Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity (> 10) and robust mechanical properties. Their scalability and low cost make them attractive for large‑scale brine treatment, provided long‑term durability is confirmed.

2. **Hybrid Polymer–MOF MMMs** provide **high permeability** while maintaining **selectivity** through MOF loading and surface functionalization. Covalent tethering and ionic‑liquid incorporation further enhance Li⁺ transport. However, the lack of quantitative interfacial resistance data and limited long‑term studies highlight the need for systematic performance validation.

3. **Ceramic nanoporous membranes** deliver **ultra‑high selectivity** (up to 930‑fold Li⁺/Na⁺) via sub‑nanometer pores and negative surface charge, and their **helical geometry** boosts permeance. Ligand functionalization and composite laminates (LLZAO–Li‑Nafion) extend applicability to battery‑related separations. The primary challenges are the verification of ligand grafting on ceramics and the assessment of fouling resistance in realistic feed streams.

**Design Principles for Optimizing Selectivity and Permeability**

| **Ligand functionalization** | Provides specific binding sites for target ions. | Crown‑ether/cryptand grafting on ceramics or polymers. |

**Practical Candidates**  
The most promising membrane candidates for Li⁺/Co²⁺/Ni²⁺ separation, based on the integrated evidence, are:

- **GO/LDH composite membranes** (vertical channels, dual‑gating).
