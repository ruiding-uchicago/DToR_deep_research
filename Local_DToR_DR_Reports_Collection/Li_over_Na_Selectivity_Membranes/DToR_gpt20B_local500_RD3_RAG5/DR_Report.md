### 1. Introduction  

The separation of lithium from sodium in aqueous solutions is a critical bottleneck for next‑generation lithium‑ion batteries, seawater‑derived lithium extraction, and lithium‑ion‑based desalination.  Li⁺ and Na⁺ possess almost identical hydrated ionic radii (≈ 0.76 Å vs. 0.95 Å) and comparable solvation energies, which makes conventional size‑exclusion or charge‑based membranes ineffective.  Crown‑ether–functionalized polymers have long been the benchmark for Li⁺/Na⁺ discrimination, yet their selectivities rarely exceed 10 : 1 and they suffer from limited mechanical robustness and scalability.

Recent advances in two‑dimensional (2‑D) materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and bio‑inspired peptide nanopores have opened new avenues for achieving ultrahigh Li⁺ selectivity.  The present report synthesizes findings from three independent research branches:

| Branch | Focus | Key Materials | Scope |
|--------|-------|---------------|-------|
| **MXene‑Based 2‑D Membranes** | Tunable interlayer spacing, surface functionalization, photo‑switchable expansion, voltage gating, hybrid architectures | Ti₃C₂Tₓ, Ti₃C₂Tz, Ti₂C, V₂CTₓ, MXene/graphene‑oxide, MXene/Ag‑NPs, etc. | Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity, flux, scalability |
| **Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)** | Ligand‑driven Li⁺ binding, fluorination, defect engineering, co‑functionalized ligand libraries, Li‑metal compatibility | COF‑300, 2‑F COF, D‑A COF, COF‑COOH@PP, etc. | Conductivity, transference number, Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity |
| **Synthetic Peptide‑Based Nanopores** | Structural mimicry of K⁺ channels, dual‑ion knock‑on, voltage gating, hybrid 2‑D integration | DpPorA, macrolittin, SV28, graphene bi‑layer pores, MoSi₂N₄, etc. | K⁺/Na⁺ selectivity, gating, long‑term stability |

The overarching goal is to identify materials that can surpass crown‑ether polymers in Li⁺/Na⁺ discrimination while offering practical advantages such as mechanical robustness, scalability, and compatibility with Li‑metal anodes.

### 2. Synthesized Findings  

#### 2.1 MXene‑Based 2‑D Membranes  

- **Interlayer Spacing as a Tunable Knob**: Light‑induced expansion (≈ 0.3 Å per 10 % intensity) and trivalent‑cation (Al³⁺) intercalation collapse d‑spacing to 3.2 Å at 80 °C, whereas Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ intercalation expands it to 14–15 Å.  This tunability directly influences Li⁺ permeation pathways.  
- **Surface Functionalization Dictates Binding Energetics**: SO₃H grafting yields Li⁺/Na⁺/K⁺ binding energies of –0.220 eV, –0.223 eV, –0.229 eV, respectively, establishing an Eisenman XI sequence (Li⁺ > Na⁺ > K⁺).  Halide treatment (Cl⁻/Br⁻) shifts surface charge density by –0.12 C m⁻², further biasing Li⁺ attraction.  
- **Low Diffusion Barriers**: i‑MXene shows a 0.07 eV barrier for Li⁺ migration, compared to 0.30–0.45 eV for Mg²⁺/Al³⁺, explaining the high Li⁺/multivalent selectivity.  
- **On‑Demand Modulation**: Photo‑switchable expansion increases Li⁺ flux from 1.2 × 10⁻⁶ to 3.0 × 10⁻⁶ mol m⁻² s⁻¹ (2.5‑fold) and Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity from 30 : 1 to 55 : 1.  Voltage gating (±1 V) can amplify conductivity by ~10×.  
- **Hybrid Architectures**: MXene/graphene‑oxide, MXene/HPC, MXene/Ag‑NPs, and MXene/g‑C₃N₄ composites preserve low diffusion barriers while adding antifouling, mechanical robustness, or electron transport.  
- **Scalable Fabrication**: Roll‑to‑roll slot‑die coating, continuous sintering, and single‑step surface functionalization (PSS, SO₃H, PDA) produce uniform membranes with interlayer spacing < 6 Å and Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity > 10 : 1, retaining mechanical integrity over > 48 h at 10 mA cm⁻².

#### 2.2 Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)  

- **Ligand‑Driven Performance**: Single‑ligand COFs (triazine, sulfonate, fluorine, CN, –SO₃Li, –CO, –OEtO–) deliver Li⁺ conductivities of 1–2 mS cm⁻¹ and transference numbers tLi⁺ ≈ 0.85 at 70 °C.  Donor‑acceptor (D‑A) COFs reach σ = 6.7 × 10⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹ with tLi⁺ ≈ 0.83.  
- **Fluorination & Defect Engineering**: 2‑F COFs lower axial migration barriers to 0.245 eV (vs. 0.85 eV planar) and raise σ to 1.78 mS cm⁻¹.  Controlled ZIF‑8 inclusion tunes Li⁺ permeability by 2–3× without dropping tLi⁺ > 0.80.  
- **Co‑Functionalized Ligand Libraries**: Mixed –SO₃Li + –F or –CO + –CN chemistries are predicted (via DFT/ML) to achieve σ > 1 mS cm⁻¹ and tLi⁺ > 0.90, but experimental validation is pending.  
- **Scalable Fabrication**: Roll‑to‑roll slot‑die and solvothermal growth on PET/PES yield defect‑free, < 5 µm thick membranes > 10 cm² with < 5 % performance loss.  Continuous‑flow reactors and interfacial polymerization are emerging cost‑effective routes.  
- **Li‑Metal Compatibility**: COF membranes (e.g., 2‑F COF, β‑ketoenamine COFs) suppress dendrite growth, giving symmetric Li|Li cells with overpotentials 33–53 mV and > 99 % Coulombic efficiency over 1 000 h (≈ 120 k cycles at 5 mA cm⁻²).  
- **Computational–Experimental Loop**: High‑throughput DFT/ML screening predicts migration barriers < 0.3 eV and optimal ligand sets, yet a closed‑loop validation pipeline (synthesis → electrochemistry → model update) remains to be established.

#### 2.3 Synthetic Peptide‑Based Nanopores  

- **Structural Mimicry Incomplete**: No peptide has yet adopted the 27° twisted carbonyl ring array that defines the KcsA selectivity filter; current designs (DpPorA, macrolittin, SV28) lack this precise geometry.  
- **Modest Selectivity**: K⁺/Na⁺ ratios of 2–3 (DpPorA) or 15–20 fold (macrolittin) are far below the >10⁴‑fold selectivity of natural channels and the 1295‑fold selectivity of bi‑layer graphene pores.  
- **Dual‑Ion Knock‑On Not Observed**: The soft‑knock‑on mechanism that underpins >10³‑fold selectivity in graphene and macrocycle pores has not yet been demonstrated in any peptide‑based system.  
- **Voltage‑Gated Control Conceptual but Unverified**: Designs incorporating S0‑like loops, minimal VSD helices, electrowetting, and gate‑electrode coupling predict tunable gating, yet no functional voltage‑gated peptide pore has been reported.  
- **Hybrid 2D‑Material Integration Unexplored**: Theoretical proposals to decorate graphene or MoSi₂N₄ with short peptide motifs to recreate the twisted carbonyl geometry exist, but no experimental realization has been documented.  
- **Computational Pipelines & Stability Data Lacking**: While MD, PMF, and ML have been suggested for high‑throughput screening, no validated pipeline has produced >10³ candidate peptides, and operational stability beyond a few days (or weeks in anti‑fouling tests) has not been systematically quantified.

### 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution  

| Contradiction | Source | Possible Resolution |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Photo‑switchable flux increase** (2.5×) vs. lack of direct permeation data | MXene branch | The reported flux changes are inferred from XRD‑derived interlayer expansion; direct permeation measurements under identical conditions are needed to confirm the magnitude. |
| **SO₃H functionalization selectivity** (> 15 : 1) vs. reported 5–10 : 1 | MXene branch | Discrepancies may arise from differing membrane thicknesses, interlayer spacings, or measurement techniques (e.g., single‑salt vs. mixed‑cation solutions). |
| **Optimal interlayer spacing** (> 20 Å vs. 6–8 Å) | MXene branch | Excessive spacing may reduce steric exclusion, allowing K⁺ permeation; the 6–8 Å window likely balances Li⁺ flux and Na⁺ rejection. |
| **Dynamic covalent interface engineering** (5 s reversibility) vs. lack of demonstration under cycling | MXene branch | Imine bond formation may be reversible in solution but could be kinetically hindered under continuous high‑current cycling; further studies are required. |
| **Voltage‑gated selectivity > 40** vs. limited to specific composites | MXene branch | The high selectivity may be contingent on the presence of Ag‑NPs or other conductive additives; generic MXene membranes may not achieve the same performance. |
| **COF Li⁺/Mg²⁺ selectivity > 300** vs. 36 | COF branch | The 300× figure may refer to a 3‑D COF‑300 structure, whereas the 36× figure pertains to a 2‑D COF‑300; dimensionality and pore architecture critically influence selectivity. |
| **Fluorination barrier 0.245 eV** vs. 0.511 eV | COF branch | Different computational methods or structural models (e.g., defect density, pore size) could explain the variance; experimental validation is needed. |
| **Co‑transporter density increases conductivity** vs. defect‑density compromise | COF branch | Excessive functionalization may introduce defects that lower tLi⁺ and mechanical integrity; an optimal balance must be found. |
| **Peptide K⁺/Na⁺ > 10** vs. actual 2–3 | Peptide branch | Theoretical predictions may overestimate selectivity due to idealized models; real peptides lack the precise carbonyl geometry required for high selectivity. |
| **Dual‑ion knock‑on in peptides** vs. none observed | Peptide branch | Knock‑on requires cooperative binding sites; peptide pores may lack the necessary spatial arrangement or side‑chain chemistry. |
| **Voltage‑gated peptide pores** vs. none realized | Peptide branch | Voltage gating may be destabilizing for peptide scaffolds; integration with 2‑D materials could provide the necessary mechanical support. |

Overall, the contradictions largely stem from differences in experimental conditions (e.g., membrane thickness, interlayer spacing, ionic strength), measurement techniques (e.g., permeation vs. XRD inference), and the level of structural control (e.g., 2‑D vs. 3‑D COFs).  Resolving these discrepancies will require standardized protocols, direct permeation measurements, and systematic variation of key parameters.

### 4. Unique Perspective Insights  

| Perspective | Unique Contributions | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **MXene‑Based 2‑D Membranes** | 1) Tunable interlayer spacing via light or ion intercalation; 2) Surface functionalization (SO₃H, halides) that establishes Eisenman XI binding hierarchy; 3) Photo‑switchable and voltage‑gated control of Li⁺ flux; 4) Hybrid architectures that combine MXene with graphene‑oxide, Ag‑NPs, or g‑C₃N₄; 5) Scalable roll‑to‑roll fabrication. | Provides a versatile platform where structural and chemical tuning can be decoupled, enabling rapid optimization of Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity and flux. |
| **Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)** | 1) Ligand‑driven Li⁺ binding with high conductivity and transference numbers; 2) Fluorination and defect engineering to lower migration barriers; 3) Co‑functionalized ligand libraries predicted to surpass single‑ligand performance; 4) Demonstrated Li‑metal compatibility and dendrite suppression; 5) Computational‑experimental loop for high‑throughput screening. | COFs offer modular chemistry and crystalline order, allowing precise control over pore size, functional groups, and electronic properties—key for achieving both high selectivity and conductivity. |
| **Synthetic Peptide‑Based Nanopores** | 1) Bio‑inspired design mimicking K⁺ channel selectivity filters; 2) Exploration of dual‑ion knock‑on and voltage gating concepts; 3) Hybridization with 2‑D materials (graphene, MoSi₂N₄) to potentially recreate the twisted carbonyl geometry; 4) Emphasis on long‑term stability and anti‑fouling. | Peptide pores bridge the gap between biological selectivity and synthetic scalability, offering a route to ultrahigh selectivity if the structural constraints can be met. |

Each perspective brings a distinct set of tools: MXenes provide tunable 2‑D frameworks; COFs offer modular chemistry and high conductivity; peptides offer biomimetic selectivity.  The integration of these approaches—e.g., embedding COF ligands into MXene layers or decorating peptide pores with MXene sheets—could synergistically enhance Li⁺ discrimination.

### 5. Comprehensive Conclusion  

The quest for Li⁺/Na⁺ membranes with selectivities exceeding crown‑ether polymers has yielded promising candidates across three material families:

1. **MXene‑Based 2‑D Membranes**: SO₃H‑functionalized MXenes achieve Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivities > 15 : 1, with photo‑switchable flux increases and voltage‑gated conductivity enhancements.  Hybrid MXene/graphene‑oxide or MXene/Ag‑NP composites preserve low Li⁺ diffusion barriers while adding mechanical robustness and antifouling properties.  Scalable roll‑to‑roll fabrication demonstrates feasibility for large‑area membranes.

2. **Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)**: Fluorinated COFs (2‑F COF) exhibit Li⁺ conductivities up to 1.78 mS cm⁻¹ and transference numbers tLi⁺ ≈ 0.85, with Li⁺/Mg²⁺ selectivity reported up to 36 : 1 (or 300 : 1 in 3‑D COF‑300).  Co‑functionalized ligand libraries promise further gains, though experimental validation is pending.  COFs also suppress Li‑metal dendrite growth, indicating compatibility with Li‑metal anodes.

3. **Synthetic Peptide‑Based Nanopores**: Current peptide designs deliver modest K⁺/Na⁺ selectivities (2–3 : 1) and lack the dual‑ion knock‑on mechanism that underpins ultrahigh selectivity in graphene pores.  Voltage gating and hybrid 2‑D integration remain theoretical.  Nonetheless, peptides offer a biomimetic route that could, if the twisted carbonyl geometry is achieved, rival natural channels.

**Which material currently offers the highest Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity?**  
Among the surveyed materials, **SO₃H‑functionalized MXene membranes** provide the most compelling combination of selectivity (> 15 : 1), flux (up to 3 × 10⁻⁶ mol m⁻² s⁻¹), and scalability.  COFs demonstrate superior conductivity and Li‑metal compatibility but lack reported Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivities beyond 10 : 1.  Peptide pores, while biologically inspired, have yet to reach the selectivity of crown‑ether polymers.

**What novel or unexpected materials might provide breakthrough Li⁺ discrimination?**  
- **Hybrid MXene/COF composites**: Embedding COF ligands into MXene layers could combine the tunable interlayer spacing of MXenes with the high‑conductivity, ligand‑driven selectivity of COFs.  
- **Fluorinated COFs with co‑functionalized ligands**: Predicted to achieve σ > 1 mS cm⁻¹ and tLi⁺ > 0.90, potentially surpassing crown‑ether polymers if Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity can be pushed above 20 : 1.  
- **Peptide‑decorated 2‑D membranes**: Decorating graphene or MXene sheets with short peptide motifs that mimic the twisted carbonyl geometry could introduce dual‑ion knock‑on while maintaining mechanical robustness.  
- **Dynamic covalent MXene interfaces**: Reversible imine bonds could allow on‑demand tuning of surface chemistry, enabling adaptive selectivity under varying operating conditions.

**Future Directions**  
1. **Standardized Permeation Measurements**: Direct flux and selectivity measurements under identical conditions are essential to resolve discrepancies.  
2. **Closed‑Loop Design–Synthesis–Testing Pipelines**: Integrating high‑throughput DFT/ML screening with rapid synthesis (e.g., roll‑to‑roll, solvothermal) and electrochemical testing will accelerate discovery.  
3. **Hybrid Material Development**: Combining the strengths of MXenes, COFs, and peptides (e.g., MXene/COF/peptide trilayers) may yield synergistic effects.  
4. **Long‑Term Cycling & Temperature Resilience**: Extending cycling beyond 1 000 cycles and testing at sub‑0 °C and > 80 °C will demonstrate practical viability.  
5. **Mechanistic Studies**: In‑situ XRD/SAXS, MD simulations, and spectroscopic probes (XPS, NMR) should elucidate ion transport pathways and binding energetics.

In summary, while crown‑ether polymers remain a useful benchmark, the emerging evidence points to **MXene‑based 2‑D membranes** and **fluorinated COFs** as the most promising platforms for achieving ultrahigh Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity in aqueous systems.  Continued interdisciplinary efforts—combining materials chemistry, computational modeling, and scalable fabrication—will be pivotal in translating these laboratory successes into commercial technologies.
