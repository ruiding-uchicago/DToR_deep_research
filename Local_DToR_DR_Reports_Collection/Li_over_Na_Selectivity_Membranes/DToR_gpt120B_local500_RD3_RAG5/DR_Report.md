## 1. Introduction

Lithium extraction from seawater, brines, and industrial waste streams is hampered by the near-identical effective hydrated radii of Li⁺ (\~3.4 Å) and Na⁺ (\~3.6 Å) and by their comparable solvation shells, noting that reported values vary with the definition of hydration radius and measurement method.

The present report surveys three cutting-edge research branches that explore **novel, non-crown-ether pathways** to achieve *ultrahigh* Li⁺ discrimination:

1. **Bio-inspired artificial ion channels** – peptide-functionalised covalent-organic-framework (COF) nano-channels that mimic natural Li⁺-transport proteins.
2. **COF nano-channels with tunable hard-Lewis-acid sites** – mixed-metal (Ti⁴⁺/Zr⁴⁺) frameworks that combine sub-nanometre confinement with inner-sphere coordination.
3. **2-D material heterostructures with atomically precise defect functionalisation** – graphene/hexagonal-BN (h-BN) stacks, Al³⁺-substituted h-BN, peptide or DNA-origami nanotubes, and MXene laminates that generate high-field electrostatic wells for Li⁺.

The goal is to identify which material class presently offers the **highest Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity**, to highlight unexpected or “break-through” candidates, and to assess their readiness for industrial-scale membrane processes (ED/RED, nanofiltration, pressure-driven separations).

## 2. Synthesized Findings

### 2.1 Common Mechanistic Themes

| Mechanism                                           | Evidence Across Branches                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hard-Lewis-acid coordination** (Ti⁴⁺, Zr⁴⁺, Al³⁺) | DFT/MD studies show strong inner-sphere binding of partially dehydrated Li⁺ to Ti⁴⁺/Zr⁴⁺ sites in COFs; Al³⁺ substitution in h-BN creates deep electrostatic wells that preferentially trap Li⁺. |
| **Sub-nanometre confinement** (0.5–0.9 nm pores)    | Peptide-COF hybrids, mixed-metal COFs, and MXene inter-layer spacings all enforce partial dehydration, raising the free-energy barrier for Na⁺ entry.                                            |
| **Partial dehydration + specific binding**          | Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on Ti-COFs confirms Li⁺ loses 1–2 water ligands before coordination; similar behaviour inferred for Al-doped h-BN via MD.                           |
| **Bio-mimicry of ion-protein selectivity**          | Short β-sheet-forming peptides embedded in COF channels reproduce the selectivity of natural Li⁺-transport proteins (SF ≈ 30–70×).                                                               |
| **Robust scaffold + functional surface**            | Imine-linked COFs, graphene/h-BN heterostructures, and MXene laminates provide chemical inertness, while surface-grafted hydrophilic brushes (PEG, zwitterionic sulfobetaine) mitigate fouling.  |

All three branches converge on the **dual requirement** of (i) a *hard, Lewis-acidic centre* that can form an inner-sphere complex with Li⁺ after partial dehydration, and (ii) a *geometrically restrictive pore* that, by imposing a higher dehydration penalty and tighter coordination geometry, disfavors Na⁺ entry.

### 2.2 Performance Highlights

Unless otherwise noted, selectivity factors (SF) refer to transport selectivity under flow; static sorption ratios or binary-salt measurements can yield higher apparent SF and are not directly comparable.

\*Numbers are taken directly from the supplied branch summaries; “n/a” denotes data not reported.

### 2.3 Process-Level Validation

* **Electrodialysis (ED) / Reverse Electrodialysis (RED):** Peptide-COF hybrids have been tested at 30 mA cm⁻², delivering Li⁺ fluxes comparable to commercial anion-exchange membranes while suppressing Na⁺ leakage. MXene laminates, owing to their intrinsic conductivity, have shown promise for RED where simultaneous ion selectivity and power generation are required.

* **Nanofiltration (NF) / Pressure-driven modules:** Mixed-metal COF thin-film composites (TFC) operate at 1–3 bar with water permeabilities similar to commercial NF membranes, offering a drop-in replacement for brine concentration steps.

* **Chemical Cleaning (CIP):** Peptide-COF hybrids survive > 100 alkaline/acidic cycles with ≤ 15 % loss of selectivity; Al-doped h-BN retains > 90 % selectivity after repeated NaOH/H₃PO₄ cleaning, whereas DNA-origami channels require gentler enzymatic protocols to avoid structural damage.

Overall, **selectivity** (SF) and **flux** are the two performance axes that differentiate the candidates, and both are sensitive to feed speciation (e.g., Mg²⁺/Ca²⁺/SO₄²⁻) and ionic strength. The Al-doped h-BN/graphene heterostructure currently leads on SF (> 180×) while maintaining a respectable flux (≈ 2 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹). Peptide-COF hybrids excel in durability and stack compatibility, whereas mixed-metal COFs provide a more straightforward, scalable synthetic route.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Selectivity ranking** – peptide-COF (SF 30–70×) vs. Al-doped h-BN (> 180×) vs. MOF-74 variants (> 80×)                                            | Bio-inspired branch (claim of highest) vs. 2-D heterostructure branch (Al-doped claim) vs. COF branch (counter-claim of MOF-74) | The discrepancy stems from **different testing conditions** (e.g., concentration, current density, presence of multivalent ions). Al-doped h-BN measurements were performed in simplified 0.5 M LiCl/NaCl solutions, whereas peptide-COF data include realistic ED current densities and long-term CIP. MOF-74 selectivity is based on *static* batch sorption, not transport under flow. A fair comparison requires a unified benchmark (e.g., 0.1 M Li⁺/Na⁺, 1 bar pressure, 30 mA cm⁻²). Until such cross-lab studies are performed, the claim that any single material is “the highest” remains provisional.                                 |
| **Chemical stability of imine-linked COFs** – claimed inert to strong bases/acids vs. hydrolysis risk at pH > 13                                    | COF branch (stability claim) vs. counter-statement (hydrolysis)                                                                 | Imine linkages are indeed **susceptible to hydrolysis** under extreme pH, but the **β-ketoenamine** variant (used in many high-performance COFs) is markedly more resistant. The branch summary conflated “imine-linked” with “β-ketoenamine-linked”. Clarifying the exact linkage chemistry resolves the contradiction: β-ketoenamine COFs are stable; pure imine COFs would require protective coatings (e.g., ALD silica).                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Scalability of peptide production** – claim of feasible ton-scale vs. counter-statement of prohibitive cost                                       | Bio-inspired branch (scale-up roadmap) vs. counter-statement (cost)                                                             | Peptide synthesis at kilogram scale is already routine for pharmaceutical intermediates; however, **industrial-scale (> ton)** production would need **fermentation-based recombinant expression** and downstream purification, which adds cost. The contradiction reflects **different cost assumptions** (lab-scale vs. commercial). A techno-economic analysis (TEA) suggests that, if peptide length is ≤ 12 residues and production is outsourced to high-volume biotech facilities, the material cost could be reduced by one to two orders of magnitude relative to lab-scale synthesis, making membrane fabrication economically viable. |
| **Fouling mitigation** – PEG brushes claimed to eliminate organic fouling vs. oxidative degradation in chlorine-rich brines                         | 2-D heterostructure branch (PEG claim) vs. counter-statement (PEG oxidation)                                                    | PEG oxidation is a known issue in oxidative environments. The resolution is to **replace PEG with more robust zwitterionic brushes** (e.g., sulfobetaine) or to **apply a thin protective ALD Al₂O₃ over-coat** that preserves hydrophilicity while shielding PEG from radicals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **High-current mechanical endurance** – peptide-COF hybrids claimed to survive > 10 000 h at 60 °C vs. concern about micro-cracking above 150 A m⁻² | Bio-inspired branch (durability) vs. counter-statement (high-current stress)                                                    | The reported 10 000 h test was performed at **30 mA cm⁻²**. Extrapolation to **150 A m⁻²** (≈ 5 × higher current density) introduces **greater electro-osmotic drag** and **thermal gradients**, which can indeed cause micro-cracking. The contradiction highlights a **gap in high-current testing**; future work should include accelerated fatigue tests at industrial current densities to verify the claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Overall, most contradictions arise from **different experimental scopes** (static sorption vs. flow transport, mild vs. extreme pH, low vs. industrial current densities) rather than fundamental disagreements about mechanisms. Recognising these contextual differences allows a coherent synthesis: each material class excels under a specific set of operating conditions.

Each perspective therefore adds **a distinct design space**: peptide-COF hybrids excel in biomimicry and stack compatibility; mixed-metal COFs excel in synthetic simplicity and scalability; 2-D heterostructures excel in raw selectivity and mechanical strength. Together they map the full landscape of **structure-function-process** relationships for Li⁺/Na⁺ separation.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The multi-perspective analysis reveals that **no single material yet satisfies every industrial requirement** (ultrahigh selectivity, high flux, low cost, and proven durability under extreme CIP). Nevertheless, the collective evidence points to three leading candidates:

1. **Al³⁺-doped h-BN/graphene heterostructures** currently hold the **highest transport Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity reported for scalable inorganic membranes (> 180×)** while delivering fluxes of ≈ 2 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹ and demonstrating mechanical robustness suitable for pressure-driven modules. Their scalability via CVD and the possibility of large-area roll-to-roll production make them the most promising *high-performance* membrane for applications where **maximum Li⁺ rejection** is paramount (e.g., pre-concentration of seawater before downstream processing).

2. **Peptide-functionalised COF hybrids** achieve the **best combination of selectivity (30–70×), durability (> 10 000 h), and stack compatibility**. Their ability to survive repeated harsh CIP cycles and to be inserted into existing ED modules without redesigning the electrical architecture makes them the most **immediately deployable** technology for pilot-scale lithium recovery.

3. **Mixed-metal Ti/Zr COFs** provide a **balanced performance** (SF 20–35×, flux ≈ 1 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹) with a synthesis route that is already compatible with roll-to-roll thin-film casting. They fill the niche of **drop-in NF replacements** for brine concentration, where moderate selectivity is acceptable but high throughput is essential.

4. **DNA-origami and peptide nanotube membranes** illustrate a **bio-mimetic dipole-field mechanism** that can push selectivity to ≈ 200×, but their current production cost and susceptibility to enzymatic degradation limit near-term commercialisation.

5. **MXene laminates** uniquely combine **electrical conductivity** with moderate selectivity (≈ 50×), positioning them as the preferred membrane for **RED power-generation** where simultaneous ion transport and electron flow are required.

**Answer to the original research question:**
*At present, the material that exhibits the **highest experimentally reported Li⁺/Na⁺ transport selectivity** for a scalable inorganic membrane is the **Al³⁺-substituted h-BN/graphene heterostructure**, delivering selectivity factors exceeding 180 while maintaining a flux comparable to MXene laminates. However, when durability under industrial electrodialysis conditions and compatibility with existing stack hardware are weighted, the **bio-inspired peptide-COF hybrid** emerges as the most practical high-performance candidate. Mixed-metal COFs and MXene laminates occupy the middle ground, offering scalable synthesis and respectable fluxes with moderate selectivity.*

The multi-perspective approach has clarified that **ultrahigh Li⁺ selectivity is achievable** when hard-Lewis-acid sites are paired with sub-nanometre confinement, and that **different material families excel under different process windows**. Future research should focus on (i) establishing a **standardised transport benchmark** across all material classes, (ii) performing **high-current mechanical endurance tests**, and (iii) completing **techno-economic assessments** for peptide-based and defect-engineered 2-D membranes. Such coordinated efforts will enable the field to move from laboratory proof-of-concepts to commercial lithium-recovery membranes that can operate reliably in the harsh chemical environments of seawater and brine processing.
