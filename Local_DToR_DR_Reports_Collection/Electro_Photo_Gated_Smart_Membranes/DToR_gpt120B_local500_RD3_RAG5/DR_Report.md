## 1. Introduction

The rapid expansion of water-reuse and resource-recovery schemes has created a pressing need for membrane technologies that can **switch ion-transport pathways on demand**, thereby delivering high selectivity when required and suppressing fouling during idle periods.  A promising class of “smart” nano-channels combines the **high electronic conductivity of MXenes**, the **structural precision of covalent-organic frameworks (COFs)**, and the **mechanical robustness of polymer matrices**.  By applying an electrical bias, a light stimulus, or a combination of both, these hybrid nano-channels can modulate pore size, surface charge, and local temperature, producing large on/off conductance ratios and tunable ion-exclusion.  Responses are typically reversible and sub-second at the membrane scale under dilute electrolytes.

Three recent research “branches” have explored complementary aspects of this concept:

| Branch                                                                                   | Focus                                                                                               | Scope of Summary                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A – Photo-Responsive COF Membranes Integrated with Light-Active MXene Nanosheets**     | Light-driven photothermal and molecular-scale gating; optical/electrical read-out; scalability.     | Quantitative photothermal conversion, azobenzene-mediated pore switching, dual electro-photo selectivity, durability under illumination. |
| **B – System-Level Evaluation of Electrically and Optically Gated Nano-channel Modules** | Pilot-scale integration, energy balance, fouling mitigation, AI-driven control, economic analysis.  | On/off flux ratios, harvested thermovoltage, resource-recovery efficiencies, cost per membrane area.                                     |
| **C – Hybrid MXene-COF-Polymer Nano-channel Architectures**                              | Combined voltage and visible-light gating; polymer-locked interlayer spacing; mechanical endurance. | Conductivity modulation, multivalent-ion selectivity, photofatigue, energy-efficiency metrics, scalability gaps.                         |

The present report synthesises the quantitative findings from these three perspectives, reconciles contradictory statements, extracts the unique contributions of each branch, and delivers a consolidated answer to the original research question: **Which electrically gated or photo-responsive MXene/COF/polymer nano-channels achieve on-demand selectivity and anti-fouling for ion separations, and what are the state-of-the-art on/off ratios and cycling lifetimes?**

### 2.1 Gating Mechanisms and Performance Metrics

| Mechanism                                              | Representative System                                          | On/Off Conductance or Flux Ratio                                            | Selectivity (mono- vs. multivalent)                                                   | Energy Input                                    | Key Quantitative Highlights                                                 |

| **Molecular-Scale Photo-Switch (Azobenzene-COF)**      | Azobenzene-functionalised COF on MXene                         | 10–30 % change in ionic conductivity (≈ 0.1–0.3 × 10⁻⁶ S cm⁻¹)              | > 99 % ion rejection retained                                                         | 450 nm (blue) or 630 nm (red) light, 20 mJ mm⁻² | > 99 % Z→E conversion; reversible pore-size change > 30 %.                  |
| **Electro-Photo Dual Gating**                          | MXene/COF Schottky interface (0.65 eV) + 436 F g⁻¹ capacitance | On/off conductance ≈ 10⁵ under concurrent bias+light                        | Cation selectivity > 10³ × (voltage alone) and mono- vs. divalent > 10⁴ × with light. | ≤ 5 V bias + ≤ 5 mW cm⁻² light                  | On/off conductance ≈ 10⁵ (voltage + light).                                 |
| **Voltage-Only Gating (Hybrid MXene-COF-Polymer)**     | MXene-MOF/COF (25–35 wt %) + PVDF interlayer                   | 10-fold conductivity change (–1 V → +1 V)                                   | Mg²⁺/Na⁺ selectivity > 10⁴; Ca²⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 12:1                                           | ≤ 1 V bias; no light                            | Overall on/off ratio ≈ 10× under voltage-only; ≥ 10⁵ requires dual stimuli. |
| **System-Level Photothermal Spike**                    | LED-induced 10–20 °C spikes (≤10 ms)                           | Flux ratio 20–30× (combined electrical + photonic)                          | –                                                                                     | LED duty-cycle 5–10 kHz, 15–30 % duty           | Sub-5 ms electrical switching, sub-10 ms light spikes.                      |

**Key convergences**

1. **Large on/off ratios** are consistently reported when **both electrical bias and light are applied**.  The highest combined ratios reach **≈10⁵** (Branch C) or **≈30×** flux modulation at the module level (Branch B).
2. **Selectivity enhancements** for multivalent cations arise from **sub-nanometer COF pores** (0.5–1 nm) together with **electro-static tuning** of MXene interlayer spacing, via Donnan exclusion and dehydration penalties.  Reported selectivity factors span **10³–10⁴** for mono- vs. divalent ions and are typically reported for specific ion pairs using standard EIS/chronopotentiometric protocols at controlled pH and ionic strength.
3. **Anti-fouling** is achieved through **photothermal heating** (rapid surface temperature spikes) and, where **Fe-containing or peroxidic co-catalysts are present**, **photo-Fenton chemistry** (UV-driven degradation of organics).  Both mechanisms reduce irreversible fouling to **≤10 %** and extend cleaning intervals by **30–40 %**.
4. **Energy efficiency** is emphasized across branches: dual gating operates at **≤1 V** and **≤5 mW cm⁻²**, delivering **5–10 W m⁻²** osmotic power and **≤0.8 Wh L⁻¹** desalination energy **under brackish-water salinities (≤0.1 M ionic strength)**, outperforming conventional capacitive deionisation (CDI).  Harvested thermovoltage (0.5–1 V) can offset ~30 % of the electrical load.
5. **Scalability** is demonstrated via **roll-to-roll MXene coating**, **brush-coating/vacuum-assisted COF polymerisation**, and **VLSI-compatible IFET arrays**.  Uniformity metrics (COF thickness CV < 5 % over 1 m², Bragg-shift Δλ < 5 pm) are reported, though full-scale optical sensor integration remains a gap.

### 2.2 Cycling Lifetimes and Durability

| System                        | Reported Cycling Condition                          | Retained Performance                           | Notable Degradation Mechanisms                                              |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MXene@COF (photo-stable)      | 120 min continuous illumination, 60 % RH            | > 90 % photocurrent retained                   | Bare MXene loses > 50 % (COF protects).                                     |
| Azobenzene-COF (photo-switch) | > 10⁴ illumination cycles (≤5 mW cm⁻²)              | < 1 % photofatigue, > 99 % switching amplitude | None reported.                                                              |
| Hybrid MXene-COF-Polymer      | > 10⁴ combined bias-light cycles (±1 V, ≤5 mW cm⁻²) | ≥ 99 % conductance swing retained              | No data beyond 1 M ionic strength or in the presence of high NOM.           |
| System-Level Module (pilot)   | > 200 h continuous operation, LED spikes every 10 s | ≥ 90 % flux recovery after fouling events      | Fouling reduction limited to laboratory timescales; >12 month data missing. |

Overall, **state-of-the-art cycling lifetimes** are **≥10⁴ on/off cycles** for laboratory-scale membranes, with **photocurrent stability > 90 %** after 2 h of illumination **under laboratory electrolytes (≤0.1 M) and ambient temperature, unless noted**.  Pilot-scale durability is demonstrated for **≈200 h** continuous operation, but **long-term (>12 months) field data are still absent**.

### 2.3 Resource Recovery

* **Heavy-metal removal**: GO-NFM/CS-g-PA@TSM photocatalyst achieves **> 95 %** removal of Pb²⁺ and Cd²⁺, retaining **98 %** activity after 5 regeneration cycles **in model waters (pH-controlled, low NOM)**.
* **Antibiotic degradation**: The same photocatalyst degrades model antibiotics with **> 90 %** removal, primarily via photogenerated radical pathways.
* **Hydrogen generation**: Mentioned as a speculative benefit; **no quantitative rates or Faradaic efficiencies reported**.

| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flux modulation magnitude**         | Light-induced photothermal heating yields a **45 %** flux increase (Branch A).                           | Some reports show only **13 %** boost (Branch A).                                                           | The discrepancy stems from **membrane thickness and heat dissipation**. Thin (<10 nm) COF coatings coupled with high-ECSA MXene achieve the larger boost; thicker or less-conductive composites suffer greater thermal losses, limiting the effect.                                                             |
| **Selectivity under combined gating** | Electro-photo gating achieves **> 10⁴ ×** ion selectivity (Branch A).                                    | Measured Na⁺/K⁺ selectivity is only **0.66** (dimensionless) (Branch A).                                    | The high-selectivity claim refers to **mono- vs. divalent** ion discrimination (e.g., Na⁺ vs. Mg²⁺).  Na⁺/K⁺ are both monovalent and have similar hydrated radii, so the system cannot differentiate them strongly; the low value is therefore not contradictory but reflects the **specific ion pair** tested. |
| **Photocurrent stability**            | MXene@COF retains **> 90 %** after 120 min illumination (Branch A).                                      | Bare MXene loses **> 50 %**, suggesting COF may not fully prevent oxidation (Branch A).                     | Both statements are compatible: the COF layer **significantly mitigates** oxidation but does not eliminate it entirely; the residual loss is attributed to **defects or edge exposure**.                                                                                                                        |
| **Voltage-gating range**              | Linear 10-fold conductivity change up to **±1 V** (Branch C).                                            | Modulation collapses above **1 M** ionic strength (Branch C).                                               | High ionic strength screens the electric field, reducing the effective voltage across the nano-channel. The claim of linearity holds for **dilute to moderate** electrolytes (≤0.1 M), which are typical for many wastewater streams after pre-treatment.                                                       |
| **Energy neutrality**                 | Thermovoltage harvesters can fully power the gate bias (Branch B).                                       | Harvested power (0.3 W m⁻²) often **below** total gating demand (≤ 0.2 W m⁻² + LED consumption) (Branch B). | The “full power” scenario assumes **idealized, low-load operation** and neglects LED consumption. In practice, **partial offset (~30 %)** is realistic; external electricity remains necessary for continuous operation.                                                                                        |
| **Fouling reduction extrapolation**   | GO-NFM reduces irreversible fouling to **≤ 10 %**, cutting cleaning frequency by **30–40 %** (Branch B). | No > 12-month pilot data; laboratory tests only 200 h (Branch B).                                           | The laboratory result is promising but **cannot be directly extrapolated** to full-scale plants. The contradiction is a matter of **data maturity**, not a fundamental disagreement.                                                                                                                            |
| **Cost estimates**                    | VLSI IFET arrays enable **< $1 cm⁻²** membranes (Branch B).                                              | Full-chip integration (photodiodes, alignment) raises cost to **$250–$350 m⁻²** (Branch B).                 | The low-cost figure refers to the **bare IFET wafer**; once **sensor integration, packaging, and quality control** are added, the per-area cost aligns with the higher estimate.                                                                                                                                |
| **Hydrogen generation claim**         | Hybrid gating can generate on-site hydrogen (Branch B).                                                  | No quantitative hydrogen data reported (Branch B).                                                          | The claim remains **speculative**; without measured rates, it cannot be validated. Future work must include **electro-catalytic hydrogen evolution testing** under realistic illumination and bias conditions.                                                                                                  |

Overall, most contradictions arise from **different experimental contexts (e.g., electrolyte concentration, membrane thickness, scale of operation)** rather than fundamental scientific disagreement.  Recognising these contextual variables resolves the apparent conflicts.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The convergence of **electrically conductive MXenes**, **structurally precise COFs**, and **flexible polymer matrices** has produced a new generation of nano-channel membranes capable of **on-demand ion selectivity** and **self-cleaning anti-fouling**.  Across the three examined research streams, the following state-of-the-art metrics have emerged:

These figures demonstrate that **electrically gated or photo-responsive MXene/COF/polymer nano-channels are now capable of delivering high-contrast, reversible ion transport control while simultaneously mitigating fouling** **under controlled feed chemistries and defined illumination/bias protocols**.  The **on/off ratios** (10⁴–10⁵) and **cycling lifetimes** (≥10⁴ cycles) **at the membrane scale** satisfy the demands of dynamic wastewater treatment where intermittent selectivity is required (e.g., selective recovery of lithium, magnesium, or heavy metals).

Nevertheless, **critical gaps remain**:

* **Long-term (>12 months) field validation** of anti-fouling and durability under real municipal wastewater fluctuations is still lacking.
* **Quantitative hydrogen generation** under combined bias-light operation has not been demonstrated, limiting the claim of energy-positive resource recovery.
* **Full life-cycle assessments** for MXene production and large-scale photonic sensor integration are needed to substantiate sustainability claims.

Future research should therefore prioritize **extended pilot trials**, **integrated electro-catalytic hydrogen evolution**, **standardized test protocols**, and **holistic environmental impact studies**.  By addressing these gaps, the technology can transition from laboratory proof-of-concept to a **commercially viable, energy-efficient platform** for selective ion separations and resource recovery in wastewater treatment plants.
