## 1. Introduction  

Neuromorphic sensing seeks to emulate the brain’s ability to acquire, process, and learn from sensory data in a single integrated system. The synaptic transistor—an electronic device that mimics the analog, multi‑level, and energy‑efficient behavior of a biological synapse—is a core building block. Its performance is quantified by four metrics:

| Metric | Definition | Desired direction |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Energy per event | Electrical energy required to modify the synaptic weight by one update | **Low** (fJ–pJ range) |
| Weight‑update linearity | Symmetry and linearity of conductance change versus stimulus | **High linearity** and **symmetry** |
| Retention time | Duration the device can maintain its conductance state without refresh | **Long** (hours to years) |
| Cycling endurance | Number of program/erase (P/E) cycles the device can sustain | **High** (≥10⁵ cycles) |

The **three** research branches supplied to this synthesis cover:

1. **MXene‑based MIP‑EIS micro‑plastic sensors** – showcasing the high conductivity, surface chemistry, and printable fabrication of Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXenes, which provide insights into dielectric engineering and contact metallurgy.
2. **Graphene‑aptamer FET micro‑plastic sensors** – highlighting polymer encapsulation, high‑κ dielectrics, and polymer‑semiconductor interfacial engineering that can be transferred to synaptic devices.
3. **2‑D Platforms × Architectures × Fab Levers for Synaptic Transistors** – a comprehensive survey of MoS₂, WSe₂, MoSe₂, and related heterostructures in floating‑gate, ionic‑gated, dual‑gate, and opto‑synaptic architectures, together with practical fabrication techniques.

The goal of this report is to synthesize the evidence, resolve contradictory claims, distill unique contributions of each branch, and identify the most promising 2‑D material platforms, architectures, and fabrication levers for neuromorphic sensing.

## 2. Synthesized Findings  

### 2.1 Material Platforms

| Platform | Representative 2‑D Layer | Key Electronic Property | Relevance to Synaptic Devices |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **MoS₂** | Monolayer/few‑layer | High on/off, tunable bandgap (1.8 eV), moderate mobility (∼200 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹) | Widely used as channel; benefits from gate‑coupling, low‑voltage operation |
| **WSe₂ / MoSe₂** | Monolayer | Direct bandgap, strong light–matter coupling | Enables opto‑synaptic behavior with sub‑fJ spike energy |
| **Black Phosphorus (BP)** | Few‑layer | High mobility (∼10⁴ cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹), anisotropic conduction | Potential for fast, low‑energy updates; limited by ambient stability |
| **h‑BN** | Dielectric / barrier | Wide bandgap (∼5.9 eV), atomically flat | Serves as tunneling barrier in FG, spacer in heterostructures |
| **Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene** | MXene | Extremely high conductivity, surface terminations (–OH, –F, –O) | Offers low contact resistance, robust surface chemistry for polymer attachment |
| **Graphene** | Monolayer | Zero bandgap, high mobility (>10⁴ cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹) | Provides flexible channel or floating‑gate; used in aptamer FETs |

**Convergence** – All branches point to **MoS₂** and **WSe₂** as the workhorses for synaptic devices because they combine an accessible bandgap, high gate coupling, and compatibility with various dielectrics (HZO, AlScN, h‑BN). **MXene** and **graphene** contribute contact and dielectric engineering insights that can be translated into improved synaptic stacks.

### 2.2 Device Architectures

| Architecture | Typical Stack | Energy per Event | Weight‑Update Linearity | Retention | Endurance | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Floating‑gate (FG)** | MoS₂ / h‑BN / graphene | 30–100 fJ | Near‑linear (symmetry > 90 %) | > 10⁵ s (∼4 days) | up to 10⁵ cycles | h‑BN barrier critical for tunneling control |
| **Ferroelectric FE‑FET** | MoS₂ / HZO or AlScN | 10–100 fJ (program) | Requires pulse‑shaping; non‑linear at low levels | Projected 10‑yr | > 10⁴ cycles | Non‑volatile multi‑bit states |
| **Ionic‑gated / Dual‑gate EGT** | MoS₂ / ion‑gel top gate + back gate | ≈ 12.7 fJ (dual‑gate) | Linear when ion‑injection employed | Improved by ion‑injection | Not yet benchmarked | fJ energy advantage |
| **Op‑synaptic (photo‑synaptic)** | WSe₂ / MoSe₂ channel + ferroelectric | 0.057–0.075 fJ | Linear optical conductance change | Not reported | Not reported | Ultra‑low spike energy; spectral sensing |
| **Defect‑engineered MoS₂** | Monolayer with engineered vacancies | ≈ 30 fJ | Symmetric potentiation/depression | Not reported | Not reported | Improved linearity via defect control |

**Convergence** – Across branches, **MoS₂‑based** architectures dominate in terms of scalability and proven endurance. **Dual‑gate ionic‑gated devices** offer the lowest energy, but retention requires architectural safeguards (ion‑injection). **Opto‑synaptic devices** provide unprecedented energy savings for photonic inputs.

### 2.3 Fabrication Levers

| Lever | Implementation | Effect on Performance |
|-------|----------------|-----------------------|
| **Channel Thickness Control** | Monolayer vs few‑layer MoS₂ | Monolayer yields stronger gate coupling → lower energy; thicker channels increase mobility → better endurance |
| **Dielectric Engineering** | HfZrO₂ (HZO), AlScN, h‑BN, high‑κ oxides | Ferroelectric dielectrics enable non‑volatile states; h‑BN improves tunneling uniformity; high‑κ reduces leakage |
| **Contact Metallurgy** | Semimetal vdW contacts (In/Au), 1T‑phase MoS₂ | Low contact resistance (∼123 Ω·µm) → lower write energy; vdW contacts improve cycle‑to‑cycle variability |
| **Polymer Encapsulation** | High‑κ dielectrics + hydrophobic backbones | Reduces ionic screening → improves linearity; mitigates polymer swelling (important for FET‑based sensors) |
| **Surface Functionalization** | MXene terminations, graphene aptamers | Enables robust biorecognition layers; could be adapted to introduce charge traps for synaptic memory |
| **Heterostructure Engineering** | MoS₂/h‑BN/graphene, MoS₂/WS₂, MXene–graphene | Creates built‑in fields, enhances carrier density, provides barrier layers for tunneling |

**Convergence** – All branches underline the **criticality of dielectric/encapsulation layers** and **contact engineering**. The **monolayer‑scale control** and **phase‑engineered contacts** are the most widely reported levers for reducing energy and improving endurance.

## 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution  

| Contradiction | Evidence from Branches | Possible Resolution |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Energy vs Retention Trade‑off** | Dual‑gate ionic‑gated devices report < 13 fJ per spike, yet retain only a few hours without ion‑injection; FE‑FETs show 10‑yr retention but higher energy (~10–100 fJ). | Ion‑injection or dual‑gated architectures can be engineered to lock ions into the dielectric, mitigating drift while retaining low energy. FeFETs can use thinner ferroelectric layers to reduce program energy. |
| **Linearity in Ferroelectric Devices** | Some reports claim FE‑FETs are inherently nonlinear due to polarization switching; others show near‑linear potentiation when pulse shaping is used. | Standardization of pulse schemes (rise/fall time, amplitude) can linearize FE‑FET updates. Combining FE layers with tunneling barriers (e.g., h‑BN) can suppress abrupt switching. |
| **Durability of Floating‑Gate with Graphene** | FG devices show high endurance but environmental stability of graphene FG and tunnel oxide reliability are questioned. | Process integration of encapsulation layers (Al₂O₃, Si₃N₄) and controlled growth of graphene can improve reliability. Additionally, using h‑BN as a robust barrier mitigates graphene degradation. |
| **Comparative Performance of 2‑D vs MXene** | MXene‑based sensors show exceptional conductivity and surface chemistry but are not reported as synaptic devices. | MXene can be incorporated as an ultra‑thin contact or gate electrode in synaptic stacks, leveraging its low contact resistance and functionalizable surface to create charge‑trap layers. |
| **Effectiveness of Polymer Encapsulation** | Graphene‑aptamer FETs demonstrate high sensitivity, yet polymer swelling degrades long‑term stability. | Optimized cross‑linking and hydrophobic backbones, as suggested in the graphene‑aptamer branch, can be adopted in synaptic FETs to mitigate swelling and maintain linearity. |

**Resolution** – The contradictions largely arise from *different operating regimes* (energy‑dominated vs retention‑dominated) and *different fabrication contexts* (sensor vs memory). A hybrid approach—combining a low‑energy ionic‑gated front end with a ferroelectric or floating‑gate back‑end—can reconcile energy, retention, and linearity.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion  

The integrated evidence converges on a small set of 2‑D material platforms and device architectures that, when combined with judicious fabrication levers, can deliver the energy, linearity, retention, and endurance required for practical neuromorphic sensing.

1. **MoS₂** is the workhorse channel material due to its compatibility with ferroelectric and dielectric stacks, monolayer gate coupling, and mature large‑area synthesis (CVD, exfoliation).  
2. **WSe₂ / MoSe₂** channels are essential for **opto‑synaptic** devices, where sub‑fJ spike energies are achieved through photogenerated carrier injection into a ferroelectric gate.  
3. **h‑BN** is the preferred **tunneling barrier** in floating‑gate stacks and provides an atomically flat, chemically inert interface that preserves linearity and retention.  
4. **MXene (Ti₃C₂Tₓ)** and **graphene** are valuable for **contact engineering** and for forming **charge‑trap layers** that can reduce write energy and improve device stability.  
5. **Ferroelectric dielectrics** (HfZrO₂, AlScN) and **dual‑gate ionic architectures** are the two most effective levers for achieving **low‑energy updates**; the former gives long retention, while the latter offers the lowest spike energy when coupled with ion‑injection schemes.  
6. **Fabrication levers**—channel thickness control, high‑κ/ferroelectric dielectric engineering, vdW/1T‑phase contacts, polymer encapsulation, and heterostructure stacking—have demonstrable impact on all four performance metrics.  

The most promising practical stacks are:

| Stack | Energy (fJ) | Retention | Endurance | Comments |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| MoS₂ / HZO or AlScN FE‑FET | 10–100 (program) | ~10 yr | > 10⁴ | Non‑volatile multi‑bit states, scalable |
| MoS₂ / h‑BN / graphene FG | 30–100 | > 10⁵ s | ≤ 10⁵ | Near‑linear updates, robust |
| Dual‑gate MoS₂ EGT (ion‑gel) | 12.7 | ↑ with ion‑injection | TBD | fJ energy, needs retention safeguard |
| WSe₂ / MoSe₂ opto‑synapse | 0.057–0.075 | n/a | n/a | Ultra‑low spike energy for photonic input |

**Future Work** – A hybrid device architecture that combines a low‑energy ionic‑gated front end with a ferroelectric or floating‑gate back end could achieve the full set of metrics. Integration of MXene or graphene contacts would further reduce write energy and variability. Standardization of pulse protocols and benchmark metrics is necessary to reconcile the remaining discrepancies and accelerate commercialization.
