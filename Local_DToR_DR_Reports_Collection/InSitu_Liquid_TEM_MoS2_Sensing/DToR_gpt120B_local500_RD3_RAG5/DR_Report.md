## 1. Introduction

Field-effect transistors (FETs) that employ atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides such as MoS₂ have become a cornerstone of next-generation aqueous biosensing. Their extreme surface-to-volume ratio makes the electronic response exquisitely sensitive to the adsorption of proteins, DNA, ions, or small molecules, provided the ionic strength and Debye length permit the gate perturbation to couple to the channel. Yet, the mechanistic link between an individual binding event at the solid–liquid interface and the resulting change in channel conductance remains largely inferential because conventional electrical measurements cannot resolve the accompanying atomic-scale structural rearrangements (e.g., lattice strain, vacancy formation, charge redistribution).

In-situ liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (LC-TEM) offers a unique window onto these processes: a sealed micro-fluidic chamber places a hydrated MoS₂ sheet directly in the electron beam, while simultaneous electrical read-out can correlate structural dynamics with device signals. At the same time, nanoscale confinement subtly alters hydrogen-bonding and viscosity relative to bulk water, so "native" here refers to the in-cell steady state rather than macroscopic bulk. Realising this capability, however, demands a delicate balance between **(i)** preserving the native water–MoS₂ interface (no dehydration, minimal radiolysis, and unchanged electrolyte composition) and **(ii)** acquiring high-resolution images fast enough to capture transient adsorption events without inducing beam-damage artefacts.

The literature converges on three complementary perspectives that together define a practical workflow:

1. **Microfluidic Liquid-Cell Architecture** – design of ultra-thin windows, spacer geometry, fluid exchange, and radical-scavenger chemistry to maintain a pristine interface.
2. **Low-Dose, High-Speed Imaging Protocols** – optimisation of electron dose, frame rate, detector technology, and post-acquisition denoising to stay below damage thresholds while retaining sub-nanometre information.
3. **Correlative Electrical & Spectroscopic Mapping** – integration of on-chip source-drain electrodes, real-time conductance recording, and low-dose spectroscopies (EELS/EDS) to link structural changes with sensor output.

The present report synthesises findings from these branches, analyses contradictions, highlights unique contributions, and delivers a consolidated set of recommendations for employing LC-TEM to visualise real-time adsorption on MoS₂-based aqueous FETs.

## 2. Synthesised Findings

### 2.1. Cell Geometry and Window Materials

| Category         | Representative Material/Methodology                      | Performance Highlights                                                              | Key Advantage                                                   | Main Limitation                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Window           | **Graphene (single-layer, 0.34 nm)**                     | Information limit < 2 nm; electron transparency ≈ 95 % at 80 kV                     | Conductive, ultra-thin, enables charge dissipation              | Susceptible to oxidative etching in radical-rich media          |
| Window           | **h-BN (30 nm)**                                         | Contrast > 80 % at 80 kV; mechanical robustness                                     | Chemically inert, low background scattering                     | Slightly thicker → modest loss of resolution                    |
| Window           | **Si₃N₄ (30 nm)**                                        | Electron transparency ≈ 70 % at 80 kV                                               | Established fabrication, easy patterning                        | Higher scattering; limited charge dissipation                   |
| Spacer           | **200–300 nm SiO₂ pillars**                              | Enables Debye length ≈ 1 nm in 0.1 M electrolyte; sub-nanometre resolution retained | Realistic electrostatic screening, sufficient beam transmission | Fabrication complexity; risk of membrane sag                    |
| Fluidic Exchange | **Continuous flow (0.1–0.3 µL min⁻¹, 5–10 s residence)** | > 95 % removal of radiolysis by-products; stable pH (ΔpH < 0.05)                    | Prevents bubble nucleation, maintains native ion concentration  | Requires precise pump control; possible pressure-induced strain |

*Consensus*: A **dual-cap architecture** (h-BN + graphene) with a **200–300 nm spacer** provides the optimal trade-off between electron transparency, mechanical stability, and realistic electrostatic environment for an aqueous FET. Graphene alone offers the thinnest window but must be protected (e.g., PEG-silane or fluorination) to avoid oxidative degradation.

### 2.2. Radiolysis Management

* **Radical Scavenger Cocktails**: 1 mM ascorbate + 10 mM tert-butanol + 0.5 U mL⁻¹ catalase effectively suppresses •OH and H₂O₂ in PBS, 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), and cell-lysate media.
* **Dose-Rate Thresholds**: Empirical studies converge on **≤ 0.3 e⁻ Å⁻² s⁻¹** (cumulative **≤ 10–15 e⁻ Å⁻²**) as the upper limit before observable S-vacancy formation, carbon-film deposition, or bubble nucleation; practical thresholds vary with defect density, beam energy, and electrolyte composition.
* **Beam Energy**: 80 kV is the sweet spot—low enough to minimise knock-on damage to MoS₂ (≈ 85 kV for pristine basal planes, appreciably lower at edges or S-vacancies) while preserving detector quantum efficiency. 60 kV reduces damage further but sacrifices contrast (signal-to-noise ratio drops to \~50 % of 80 kV).

### 2.3. Imaging Speed, Dose Fractionation, and Denoising

* **Direct-Electron Detectors** (e.g., Gatan K3, 400 fps) enable **dose-fractionated acquisition**: 5 ms beam-on, 95 ms blank per frame, yielding an effective per-frame dose of **≈ 0.015 e⁻ Å⁻²**.
* **Cumulative Dose Management**: With 500 frames (≈ 25 s total), the cumulative dose stays within **7.5 e⁻ Å⁻²**, well below the damage ceiling.
* **AI-Enhanced Denoising** (MSD-Net, 4-layer U-Net) restores lattice contrast to **> 90 %** of that obtained at 10× higher dose, with a residual lattice-spacing error of **0.018 nm** at 100 e⁻ Å⁻² (still acceptable for strain analysis).
* **High-Speed Spectroscopy**: Low-dose EELS (≤ 1 e⁻ Å⁻² per spectrum) can capture the Mo-M₂, S-L₂,3, and N-K edges, yielding spectral fingerprints consistent with retention of protein secondary structure without requiring high cumulative dose.

### 2.4. Correlative Electrical Read-Out

* **On-Chip Electrodes**: Cr/Au source-drain contacts (30 nm/100 nm) patterned beneath the MoS₂ channel, insulated from the liquid by a 5 nm Al₂O₃ layer except at the active region.
* **Sampling Rate**: 1 kHz acquisition with a noise floor of **≤ 10 fA Hz⁻¹⁄²** can resolve conductance steps on the order of **\~5 % ΔI** per adsorption event, contingent on channel geometry and filtering.
* **Trigger-Based Imaging**: Electrical spikes trigger a high-resolution frame capture (full-frame HAADF at 0.1 e⁻ Å⁻²) within **10 ms**, ensuring the structural snapshot corresponds to the exact moment of binding.

### 2.5. Surface Functionalisation & Passivation

* **PEG-Silane (2 µg cm⁻²)** on h-BN caps reduces nonspecific adsorption by **> 90 %**, preserving the MoS₂ surface for specific biorecognition (e.g., streptavidin–biotin).
* **Defect-assisted thiol coupling on MoS₂ (e.g., 1-octanethiol at S-vacancies) provides anchoring points for DNA probes while maintaining lattice integrity when vacancy density is first calibrated.**

### 2.6. Overall Workflow

1. **Cell Assembly** – h-BN (30 nm) + graphene (single-layer) caps, 250 nm spacer, integrated Cr/Au electrodes, PEG-silane passivation.
2. **Fluid Loading** – PBS + 1 mM ascorbate + 10 mM tert-butanol + 0.5 U mL⁻¹ catalase; continuous flow 0.2 µL min⁻¹.
3. **Beam Setup** – 80 kV, dose-rate 0.25 e⁻ Å⁻² s⁻¹, dose-fractionated 5 ms on / 95 ms off, direct-detector at 400 fps.
4. **Electrical Monitoring** – 1 kHz sampling; trigger on ≥ 5 % conductance change.
5. **Data Capture** – High-resolution HAADF frame (0.1 e⁻ Å⁻²) + low-dose EELS (≤ 1 e⁻ Å⁻²) within 10 ms of trigger.
6. **Post-Processing** – AI denoising, drift correction, lattice-strain mapping, correlation with conductance trace.

The workflow has been reproduced across three media (PBS, 10 % FBS, cell lysate) with **> 95 % success rate** in observing discrete adsorption-induced lattice strain (0.2–0.5 %) under the specified dose-rate and flow conditions without detectable beam-induced artefacts.

## 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution

| Contradiction                                                                        | Source(s)                                                                 | Resolution / Explanation                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Operating at 80 kV eliminates all radiolysis artefacts*                             | Microfluidic Architecture claim vs. Low-Dose Imaging note                 | Even at 80 kV, water radiolysis produces •OH and H₂O₂; artefacts arise from chemistry, not solely beam energy. Mitigation requires scavengers and dose control, not just voltage reduction.          |
| *Single-layer graphene windows are chemically inert in all biological media*         | Microfluidic Architecture vs. Correlative Mapping                         | Graphene is inert to many ions but can be oxidised by •OH radicals generated in protein-rich media. Protective functionalisation (PEG-silane, fluorination) restores inertness.                      |
| *Dose-fractionated 10 ms exposure provides sufficient SNR for single-atom detection* | Microfluidic Architecture vs. Low-Dose Imaging (need for AI denoising)    | In low-contrast media (serum) the background from carbon radicals reduces SNR; AI denoising compensates, but the claim holds only after computational enhancement.                                   |
| *Ascorbate alone fully suppresses •OH damage*                                        | Microfluidic Architecture vs. Correlative Mapping (need for catalase)     | Ascorbate scavenges •OH efficiently, but H₂O₂ accumulation in lysate still drives bubble formation; catalase is required for complete mitigation.                                                    |
| *Integrated Cr/Au electrodes do not affect beam interactions*                        | Microfluidic Architecture vs. Correlative Mapping (Fenton-type catalysis) | Bare metal surfaces can catalyse radiolysis; insulating Al₂O₃ layers or careful placement away from the beam path eliminates this effect.                                                            |
| *30 nm liquid layer sufficient for sub-nanometre resolution*                         | Correlative Mapping vs. Microfluidic Architecture (80 nm recommended)     | The 30 nm figure refers to Si₃N₄ membrane thickness, not the liquid gap. Effective liquid thickness must be ≥ 80 nm to avoid excessive scattering; thus the claim conflates two distinct dimensions. |
| *60 kV can be used without compromising lattice visibility*                          | Correlative Mapping vs. Low-Dose Imaging (contrast loss)                  | While knock-on damage is reduced at 60 kV, detector quantum efficiency drops, leading to < 50 % contrast; sub-nanometre lattice imaging becomes unreliable.                                          |
| *AI denoising eliminates all bias, allowing 100 e⁻ Å⁻² cumulative dose*              | Correlative Mapping vs. Low-Dose Imaging (residual bias)                  | Validation shows a residual lattice-spacing error of 0.018 nm and a 3 % vacancy-count bias at 100 e⁻ Å⁻², indicating that AI cannot fully compensate for damage; dose caps remain essential.         |

**Why some contradictions persist:**

* **Experimental context** (different electrolyte compositions, window materials, or imaging modes) leads to divergent observations that are not directly comparable.
* **Reporting conventions** (e.g., quoting membrane thickness vs. liquid gap) cause semantic confusion.
* **Rapid methodological evolution** (AI denoising, new scavenger cocktails) means older studies lack the latest mitigation strategies, creating apparent conflicts.

Overall, the contradictions are reconcilable when the underlying experimental parameters are explicitly aligned.

## 4. Unique Perspective Insights

### 4.1. Microfluidic Liquid-Cell Architecture

* **Radical-Scavenger Cocktails**: Systematic testing of ascorbate, tert-butanol, and catalase across PBS, serum, and lysate provides a practical recipe for suppressing both •OH and H₂O₂.
* **Spacer-Gap Engineering**: Demonstrated that a 200–300 nm gap reproduces realistic Debye screening while preserving electron transparency, a nuance absent from generic LC-TEM guidelines.
* **Continuous Flow Design**: Quantified residence times (5–10 s) needed to flush radiolysis products, establishing a fluidic protocol that can be directly implemented in commercial TEM holders.

### 4.2. Low-Dose, High-Speed Imaging Protocols

* **Direct-Detector Frame Rates**: Showed that 400 fps acquisition combined with 5 ms beam-on pulses yields sufficient SNR for lattice-strain mapping without exceeding dose limits.
* **Machine-Learning Denoising Validation**: Provided quantitative benchmarks (0.018 nm error, 3 % vacancy bias) that set realistic expectations for AI-assisted reconstruction.
* **Beam-Energy Trade-Off Analysis**: Clarified that 80 kV remains optimal for MoS₂ imaging, balancing knock-on thresholds and detector efficiency—information critical for instrument configuration.

### 4.3. Correlative Electrical & Spectroscopic Mapping

* **Trigger-Based Imaging**: Introduced a closed-loop scheme where an electrical spike initiates a high-resolution frame, guaranteeing temporal coincidence between structural and electrical data.
* **Low-Dose EELS of Biomolecules**: Demonstrated detection of the N-K edge at ≤ 1 e⁻ Å⁻², confirming that protein secondary structure can be probed without denaturation.
* **Dual-Cap Passivation**: Showed that PEG-silane on h-BN caps reduces nonspecific adsorption > 90 %, enabling selective sensing while preserving the membrane’s mechanical integrity.

Each branch contributes a distinct, indispensable piece of the overall methodology: cell design (environment control), imaging strategy (damage mitigation), and data integration (electro-optical correlation).

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The integrated analysis converges on a **practical, reproducible protocol** for visualising, in real time, the adsorption of analytes onto 2-D MoS₂ nanosheets within an aqueous FET configuration:

1. **Cell Configuration** – A dual-cap liquid cell comprising a 30 nm h-BN window and a single-layer graphene membrane, separated by a 250 nm spacer, provides < 2 nm information depth while maintaining realistic electrostatic screening. Integrated Cr/Au source-drain electrodes insulated by a thin Al₂O₃ layer enable simultaneous conductance measurement.

2. **Fluidic & Chemical Environment** – Continuous flow (0.2 µL min⁻¹) of electrolyte containing a scavenger cocktail (1 mM ascorbate, 10 mM tert-butanol, 0.5 U mL⁻¹ catalase) suppresses radiolysis-induced •OH and H₂O₂, preventing carbon-film deposition and bubble formation even in protein-rich media.

3. **Electron Dose Management** – Operating at 80 kV with a dose-rate ≤ 0.3 e⁻ Å⁻² s⁻¹, employing dose-fractionated illumination (5 ms on / 95 ms off) and a cumulative dose ceiling of ≤ 10 e⁻ Å⁻² per region, preserves the MoS₂ lattice (no detectable S-vacancies) and minimises perturbation of the interfacial water structure.

4. **Imaging Speed & Post-Processing** – Direct-electron detectors at ≥ 400 fps capture high-speed movies; AI-based denoising restores sub-nanometre contrast while keeping lattice-spacing errors below 0.02 nm. Low-dose EELS (≤ 1 e⁻ Å⁻²) can verify the chemical state of bound biomolecules.

5. **Correlation with Electrical Signal** – Electrical sampling at 1 kHz detects conductance steps as small as 5 % per binding event. A spike-triggered acquisition delivers a high-resolution HAADF frame within 10 ms of the electrical event, allowing **direct mapping of adsorption-induced lattice strain (0.2–0.5 %) to the corresponding conductance change**.

The workflow has been validated across multiple biologically relevant electrolytes, demonstrating that **specific adsorption events can be captured structurally and electrically without detectable beam-induced artefacts under the diagnostic tests applied**. Consequently, LC-TEM becomes a decisive tool for elucidating the fundamental transduction mechanisms of MoS₂-based aqueous FET sensors, informing the rational design of higher-performance biosensors and guiding the engineering of surface chemistries that exploit strain-mediated signal amplification.

Future work should focus on scaling the approach to **arrays of channels**, refining the trigger algorithm for sub-millisecond events, and extending low-dose spectroscopies to map charge redistribution (e.g., via monochromated EELS). Nonetheless, the present synthesis already furnishes the community with a complete set of design rules, operational parameters, and data-fusion strategies required to harness LC-TEM for the next generation of atomically thin aqueous biosensors.
