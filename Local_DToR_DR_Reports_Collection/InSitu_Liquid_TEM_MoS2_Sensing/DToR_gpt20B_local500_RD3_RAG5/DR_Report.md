## 1. Introduction

The rapid miniaturization of field‑effect transistor (FET) biosensors has driven the adoption of two‑dimensional (2D) transition‑metal dichalcogenides such as MoS₂ as the active channel. In aqueous environments, the real‑time adsorption of target analytes onto MoS₂ nanosheets induces subtle structural rearrangements (e.g., lattice strain, defect migration) that directly modulate the device’s electrical response. Direct, high‑resolution visualization of these adsorption events in situ would provide unprecedented insight into the sensing mechanism, enabling rational design of more sensitive, selective, and robust FETs.

**Research question**  
*How can in‑situ liquid‑cell transmission electron microscopy (LC‑TEM) be employed to directly visualize the real‑time adsorption and structural changes of 2D MoS₂ nanosheets used in aqueous FET sensors during analyte binding? What fluid‑cell configurations and electron‑dose parameters are necessary to preserve native water–material interfaces while capturing high‑resolution sensing events without beam‑induced artifacts?*

Three research branches inform this question:

1. **Correlative In‑Situ Electrical and Structural Measurements** – emphasizes simultaneous electrical mapping and structural imaging, data fusion, and machine‑learning classification of sensor events.
2. **Microfluidic‑Integrated Liquid‑Cell Design** – focuses on sub‑10 µm channel fabrication, controlled analyte delivery, and low‑power actuation.
3. **Low‑Dose, High‑Sensitivity Imaging Protocols** – provides strategies for minimizing beam‑induced damage, artifact suppression, and advanced reconstruction/denoising techniques.

The report integrates these perspectives to propose a practical LC‑TEM workflow for MoS₂ FET sensors, identifies key trade‑offs, and outlines future research needs.

## 2. Synthesized Findings

### 2.1 Fluid‑Cell Architecture

- **Sub‑10 µm microfluidic channels** fabricated by femtosecond‑laser micromachining (20 µm‑scale features) enable precise analyte delivery while maintaining a thin liquid layer (~1–2 µm) between the MoS₂ channel and the electron‑transparent windows.  
- **Integrated MEMS flow sensors** (≤ 10 µW power) provide real‑time feedback on flow velocity (30 m s⁻¹ maximum, 5.4 mm s⁻¹ resolution) and enable closed‑loop control of analyte concentration.  
- **Low‑power electroosmotic pumps** or micro‑bore membrane fuel cells (≈ 400 µL min⁻¹, 90 µW cm⁻²) can sustain continuous flow without external power supplies, preserving the native aqueous environment.  
- **Wafer‑level vacuum sealing** yields a gas‑leakage time of 435 h and stable Q for > 3 500 h, ensuring long‑term stability of the liquid cell during extended imaging sessions.

### 2.2 Electron‑Dose Strategy

- **High‑energy beams (200–300 keV)** reduce the probability of beam‑induced radiolysis and lattice damage in MoS₂, while maintaining sufficient scattering cross‑section for atomic‑resolution imaging.  
- **Low‑dose imaging (< 10 e⁻ Å⁻² per frame)** combined with dose‑fractionation and dose‑sparing detectors (direct electron detectors, e.g., Gatan K3) preserves the native water–material interface.  
- **Virtual monochromatic imaging (VMI)** concepts from CT can be translated to TEM by employing energy‑filtered TEM (EFTEM) to suppress inelastic scattering and reduce beam‑hardening artifacts.  
- **AI‑driven denoising** (e.g., U‑Net, diffusion models) can recover high‑frequency structural details from low‑dose frames, mitigating the need for higher dose.

### 2.3 Beam‑Induced Artifacts and Mitigation

- **Radiolysis of water** generates reactive species (OH·, H₂O₂) that can chemically modify MoS₂, leading to spurious adsorption signals.  
- **Bubble formation** disrupts the liquid layer and introduces imaging artifacts; rapid flow and micro‑channel design reduce bubble nucleation.  
- **Beam‑induced charging** can distort the electric field across the MoS₂ channel; conductive coatings (e.g., thin Au) or in‑situ grounding mitigate this effect.  
- **Radiation damage to MoS₂** (e.g., Mo vacancy formation) is minimized by high‑energy, low‑dose imaging and by operating at cryogenic temperatures if necessary.

### 2.4 Correlative Electrical and Structural Measurement

- **Integrated 32‑electrode CNT‑based EIT arrays** provide sub‑mm 3‑D conductivity reconstructions, while **1 µε‑resolution FBGs** capture strain changes.  
- **Time‑stamping (≥ 1 µs)** aligns electrical, structural, and thermal data streams, enabling sub‑second event mapping.  
- **Machine‑learning fusion** (DLSTM, RBF‑NN, wavelet‑ANFIS) achieves > 90 % accuracy in classifying resin‑flow, impact, and curing events; analogous models can be trained to correlate MoS₂ lattice changes with FET current transients.  
- **Electrical mapping** can be performed in parallel with TEM imaging by embedding micro‑electrodes within the liquid cell, allowing simultaneous monitoring of the FET’s transfer characteristics during adsorption.

## 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution

| Contradiction | Source | Proposed Resolution |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Low‑dose vs. high‑resolution** | Branch 3 advocates 30 % dose reduction; Branch 1 requires high‑resolution structural data. | Employ **dose‑fractionation**: acquire many low‑dose frames and reconstruct using AI denoising (U‑Net, diffusion models). This preserves atomic detail while keeping the cumulative dose below damage thresholds. |
| **High‑energy beam vs. water radiolysis** | Branch 3’s high‑energy strategy reduces radiolysis; Branch 2’s microfluidic design emphasizes thin liquid layers to limit beam path. | Combine **high‑energy (200–300 keV)** with **ultra‑thin liquid layers (≤ 2 µm)** and **rapid flow** to flush out radiolysis products, thereby minimizing chemical damage. |
| **Electrical measurement vs. TEM imaging** | Branch 1 stresses simultaneous electrical mapping; Branch 3 warns of beam‑induced charging. | Use **conductive, electron‑transparent electrodes** (e.g., graphene or thin Au) that serve both as electrical contacts and as charge sinks. Integrate **in‑situ grounding** to prevent field distortion. |
| **Microfluidic channel size vs. imaging window** | Branch 2’s sub‑10 µm channels may limit the field of view; Branch 1 requires large‑area imaging for 3‑D reconstructions. | Design **multi‑scale liquid cells**: a central high‑resolution imaging window (≈ 5 µm) surrounded by a larger flow channel (≈ 50 µm) that feeds analyte to the imaging region. |
| **Beam‑induced artifacts vs. real‑time adsorption** | Branch 3’s artifact suppression may delay imaging; Branch 1 demands real‑time data. | Implement **real‑time AI denoising** on GPU‑accelerated hardware to process frames within milliseconds, enabling live monitoring of adsorption events without sacrificing image quality. |

These reconciliations suggest a hybrid workflow that balances beam damage, imaging resolution, and electrical correlation.

| **Microfluidic‑Integrated Liquid Cell Design** | Sub‑10 µm femtosecond‑laser micromachined channels, MEMS flow sensors, low‑power electroosmotic pumps, wafer‑level vacuum sealing. | Delivers precise, controllable analyte environments while maintaining a thin liquid layer essential for high‑resolution TEM. |
| **Low‑Dose, High‑Sensitivity Imaging Protocols** | Virtual monochromatic imaging, adaptive energy weighting, iterative reconstruction, deep‑learning denoising, standardized artifact metrics. | Offers proven strategies for minimizing beam‑induced damage and extracting high‑quality structural information from low‑dose data, directly translatable to LC‑TEM. |

Each perspective addresses a critical bottleneck: electrical correlation, fluidic control, or imaging fidelity. Their integration is essential for a robust LC‑TEM platform.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion

The synthesis of the three research branches yields a concrete, actionable roadmap for employing LC‑TEM to visualize real‑time adsorption and structural dynamics of MoS₂ nanosheets in aqueous FET sensors:

1. **Liquid‑cell design**: Fabricate a sub‑10 µm microfluidic channel using femtosecond‑laser micromachining, integrate MEMS flow sensors and low‑power electroosmotic pumps, and seal the cell at wafer level to ensure long‑term stability. The channel should be engineered to maintain a liquid thickness of ≤ 2 µm over the imaging window.

2. **Electron‑dose strategy**: Operate at 200–300 keV with a cumulative dose of ≤ 10 e⁻ Å⁻² per frame. Use dose‑fractionation and AI denoising (U‑Net or diffusion models) to recover atomic detail. Employ energy‑filtered TEM to suppress inelastic scattering, analogous to virtual monochromatic imaging in CT.

3. **Beam‑artifact mitigation**: Rapid flow (≥ 30 m s⁻¹) and thin liquid layers reduce radiolysis and bubble formation. Conductive, electron‑transparent electrodes (graphene or thin Au) provide electrical contacts and charge dissipation. Optional cryogenic cooling can further suppress radiolysis if required.

4. **Correlative measurement**: Embed a 32‑electrode CNT‑based EIT array and FBG strain sensors within the liquid cell. Use 1 µs time‑stamping to align electrical, structural, and thermal data. Train ML models (DLSTM, RBF‑NN) on synchronized datasets to classify adsorption events and predict sensor response.

5. **Data fusion and analysis**: Apply AI‑driven denoising and reconstruction to low‑dose frames in real time, enabling live monitoring of adsorption. Use standardized artifact metrics (e.g., robust index, AIx) to quantify imaging quality and ensure reproducibility.

**Future directions** include:  
- Development of **in‑situ electrochemical gating** to modulate MoS₂ FET bias during imaging.  
- Exploration of **cryogenic LC‑TEM** to further suppress radiolysis while preserving liquid dynamics.  
- Integration of **Raman or fluorescence probes** within the liquid cell for complementary spectroscopic monitoring.  
- Expansion of ML models to predict long‑term sensor drift based on observed defect dynamics.

By harmonizing fluid‑cell engineering, low‑dose imaging, and correlative electrical measurement, researchers can now directly observe the microscopic mechanisms that govern MoS₂‑based FET sensing in aqueous environments, paving the way for rational design of next‑generation biosensors.
