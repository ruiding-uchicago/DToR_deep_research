## 1. Introduction  

The rapid expansion of PFAS‑contaminated water supplies has created an urgent demand for analytical platforms that combine **ultra‑low limits of detection (LOD)**, **high selectivity**, **real‑time read‑out**, and **scalable manufacturability**. Field‑effect transistor (FET) sensors satisfy many of these criteria because the conductance of a 2D channel can be modulated by charge‑transfer events occurring at the gate surface, enabling label‑free electrical transduction. The performance of an FET, however, is dictated by the **gate‑interface material** that captures the target analyte and translates binding into an electrical signal.  

Three independent research branches have been examined to answer the central question:

| Branch | Core Concept |
|--------|--------------|
| **7f3b2e5a26b50fd2** | Molecularly imprinted 2‑D covalent‑organic‑framework (COF) monolayers as selective recognition layers on D‑shaped polymer optical fibers (optical read‑out) and their integration with SPR/FBG for temperature‑compensated sensing. |
| **d3b59cbcbf93f715** | Hybrid 2‑D heterostructures (graphene/MoS₂, graphene/Ti₃C₂Tₓ, etc.) combined with nano‑MIPs and PFAS‑specific aptamers to deliver **dual‑mode (electro‑chemical + optical)** detection. |
| **de0b08173c82343d** | MXene‑based platforms (Ti₃C₂Tx, V₂CTₓ, Nb₄C₃Tx) functionalized with AgNPs, conductive polymers, and fluorosilane passivation for electrosorptive capture and FET transduction. |

Each branch contributes a distinct perspective on material choice, functionalization strategy, signal amplification, and system‑level integration. The following sections synthesize these findings, resolve contradictions, highlight unique contributions, and ultimately answer which 2D nanomaterials or molecular probes hold the greatest promise for PFAS‑focused FET sensors.

## 2. Synthesized Findings  

### 2.1 Common Themes Across Branches  

| Theme | Evidence from Branches |
|-------|------------------------|
| **High surface‑area 2D scaffolds** – COF monolayers, graphene‑based heterostructures, and MXenes all provide atomically thin, conductive platforms that expose a maximal number of binding sites per unit area. | COF monolayers generate ≈1.2 × 10¹⁴ sites cm⁻²; graphene/MoS₂ heterostructures deliver carrier mobilities of 10³–10⁴ cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹; MXene sheets retain > 90 % conductivity after functionalization. |
| **Molecular imprinting or aptamer functionalization for selectivity** – All three approaches embed a recognition element directly onto the 2D surface. | COF‑MIP cavities give binding constants 10³–10⁴ M⁻¹; nano‑MIPs on graphene achieve LOD ≈ 7.5 × 10⁻³ µg L⁻¹; aptamer overlay reduces false‑positives > 50 %. |
| **Signal amplification via plasmonic or optical coupling** – SPR layers, Au‑nanostars, MXene‑AgNP composites, and fiber‑Bragg gratings enhance the transduction of the minute charge changes caused by PFAS binding. | COF‑MIP + 50 nm Au SPR yields RI sensitivities 4 000–9 000 nm RIU⁻¹; Au‑nanostar + MXene‑AgNP pushes LOD to 33 ppq; FBG provides temperature‑drift correction < 0.5 % of PFAS signal. |
| **Anti‑fouling / regeneration strategies** – PEG‑silane, PURO membranes, CuO@CNF catalytic cleaning, fluorosilane passivation, and conductive‑polymer intercalation all aim to preserve performance in complex matrices. | PEG‑silane reduces irreversible resistance to 0.02 × 10¹¹ m⁻¹; fluorosilane passivation limits mass loss to ≤ 5 % after 30 days; CuO@CNF enables > 80 % capacity after ≥ 10 cycles. |
| **Scalable manufacturing** – Roll‑to‑roll coating, ink‑jet/aerosol printing, and electro‑chemical delamination are repeatedly cited as routes to low‑cost, high‑throughput production. | COF monolayer roll‑to‑roll: ≥ 200 fibers h⁻¹ at $0.35 per sensor; graphene/MoS₂ heterostructure roll‑to‑roll > 100 m² h⁻¹; HF‑free MXene delamination < 5 MJ kg⁻¹. |

These convergences suggest that **the most promising FET sensor will combine a high‑mobility 2D channel (graphene, MoS₂, or MXene) with a molecularly imprinted or aptamer‑based recognition layer, reinforced by plasmonic/optical amplification and robust anti‑fouling/regeneration chemistry**.

### 2.2 Performance Highlights  

| Category | Representative Material/Methodology | Performance Highlights | Key Advantage | Main Limitation |
|----------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **COF‑MIP monolayer (optical/FET hybrid)** | β‑ketoenamine COF (≤ 30 nm) + PFOS imprint + 50 nm Au SPR | LOD = 0.12 fg L⁻¹ (10⁻⁷ ppt); RI sensitivity 4 000–9 000 nm RIU⁻¹; temperature drift < 0.5 % (FBG) | Ultra‑low LOD, batch‑to‑batch uniformity, facile roll‑to‑roll coating | Requires optical components (SPR, FBG) in addition to FET; limited long‑term field data (>12 mo) |
| **Hybrid graphene/MoS₂ heterostructure + nano‑MIP/aptamer** | Graphene/MoS₂ channel (μ ≈ 10⁴ cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹) + electropolymerised nano‑MIP + PFAS aptamer + Au‑nanostar plasmonic enhancer | Electrochemical LOD ≈ 7.5 × 10⁻³ µg L⁻¹; optical‑enhanced LOD ≈ 33 ppq; 10³‑fold on‑chip pre‑concentration; < 5 % inter‑channel deviation vs LC‑MS/MS | Dual‑mode verification reduces false positives; on‑chip enrichment; scalable ink‑jet printing | Currently only one experimentally validated PFAS aptamer; full monolithic integration not yet demonstrated |
| **MXene‑AgNP functionalized FET** | Ti₃C₂Tx + 10 wt % AgNP + PEDOT:PSS intercalation + fluorosilane passivation | LOD = 33 ppq (PFOS); 5 min assay; PFAS uptake 45–55 mg g⁻¹ at 750 ppb; > 90 % reversible recovery after voltage reversal | High electrosorptive capacity, rapid response, low‑energy HF‑free synthesis | Quantitative adsorption data for passivated MXene missing; long‑term (>100 cycles) durability not fully reported |

Collectively, the data demonstrate that **sub‑ppt detection is achievable** when a high‑mobility 2D channel is paired with a highly specific imprint or aptamer and an optical/plasmonic amplification scheme. The choice among COF, graphene‑based heterostructures, or MXenes hinges on the target application’s priorities (e.g., ultra‑low LOD vs. ease of integration vs. sustainability).

## 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution  

| Contradiction | Source(s) | Analysis & Resolution |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| **LOD claim for COF‑MIP alone** – “sub‑pg L⁻¹ detection without optical amplification” vs. “raw capacitance change only reaches low‑pM range” | Branch 7f3b2e5a26b50fd2 (both statements) | The COF‑MIP provides a dense array of binding sites, but the **electrical signal from a pure FET gate without field enhancement is limited by charge screening in aqueous media**. Optical SPR/HTM amplification concentrates the evanescent field, converting minute binding events into measurable RI shifts. Hence, the contradiction resolves by recognizing that **COF‑MIP alone yields low‑pM LODs; sub‑fg L⁻¹ requires the added optical layer**. |
| **Temperature compensation** – “single‑mode D‑shaped fiber with Au film is temperature‑independent” vs. “temperature‑induced RI shifts dominate, requiring FBG” | Branch 7f3b2e5a26b50fd2 | Temperature changes affect both the refractive index of the surrounding medium and the metal film’s dielectric function. The **FBG provides an independent temperature read‑out**, enabling post‑processing correction. The claim that the sensor is temperature‑independent is therefore **over‑optimistic**; the resolution is to adopt **active temperature compensation (FBG or on‑chip thermistor)** for < 0.5 % drift. |
| **Selectivity of a single imprint** – “one imprint can detect any PFAS” vs. “multiple imprints needed for reliable multiplexing” | Branch 7f3b2e5a26b50fd2 | PFAS family members differ in chain length and functional groups, leading to **varying binding affinities**. A single cavity geometry yields selectivity factors of 10–20, insufficient when several PFAS coexist at similar concentrations. **Multiplexed imprinting (≥ 3 distinct cavities) or orthogonal aptamer layers** resolves this limitation. |
| **Number of PFAS aptamers** – “only one aptamer exists” vs. “computational pipeline can generate > 10 high‑affinity aptamers in minutes” | Branch d3b59cbcbf93f715 | The first statement reflects the **current experimental library**, while the second describes a **theoretical/computational capability** that has not yet been fully validated experimentally. The contradiction persists until **high‑throughput SELEX or in‑silico validation** translates computational designs into functional aptamers. |
| **Regeneration durability** – “COF‑MIP retains > 80 % capacity after ≥ 10 cycles” vs. “MXene voltage‑reversal shows < 10 % loss after 10 cycles but no data beyond 100 cycles” | Branches 7f3b2e5a26b50fd2 & de0b08173c82343d | Both materials demonstrate **short‑term reversibility**, yet **long‑term (> 100 cycles) data are missing**. The contradiction is not a true conflict but a **knowledge gap**; systematic cycling studies are required for both platforms to confirm durability. |
| **Environmental impact of MXene synthesis** – “HF‑free route eliminates hazardous waste” vs. “LCA still lacks complete waste‑water and end‑of‑life data” | Branch de0b08173c82343d | The claim of “eliminating hazardous waste” refers to **absence of HF in the delamination step**, but **other process streams (e.g., solvents, electrolytes) remain**. The resolution is to **complete the life‑cycle inventory** before declaring MXenes environmentally superior. |

Overall, most contradictions stem from **different stages of maturity** (proof‑of‑concept vs. scale‑up) or **incomplete data** rather than fundamental scientific disagreement. Addressing the identified gaps (long‑term field validation, extensive aptamer libraries, full LCA) will harmonize the perspectives.

### 4.3 Branch de0b08173c82343d – MXene‑Based Platforms  

* **MXenes (Ti₃C₂Tx, V₂CTₓ, Nb₄C₃Tx)** combine **metallic conductivity with abundant surface terminations (–OH, –F, –O)** that can be **chemically tuned** for PFAS affinity.  
* **AgNP decoration** and **conductive‑polymer intercalation** (PEDOT:PSS, PANI) **prevent restacking**, preserve high capacitance, and **introduce plasmonic hotspots** for SERS‑type amplification.  
* **Fluorosilane passivation** offers **environmental stability** (≤ 5 % mass loss after 30 days) while **enhancing PFAS adsorption** (> 10 % increase).  
* **HF‑free electro‑chemical delamination** reduces the **energy footprint (< 5 MJ kg⁻¹)** and **eliminates hazardous waste**, positioning MXenes as a **sustainable alternative** to COFs and graphene.  

Each branch therefore contributes a **distinct combination of material science, surface chemistry, and device engineering** that, when cross‑referenced, outlines a roadmap toward the ideal PFAS‑FET sensor.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion  

The comparative analysis of three cutting‑edge research streams converges on a **clear design principle** for the next generation of PFAS‑sensing FETs:

1. **Select a high‑mobility 2D channel** – graphene, MoS₂, or MXene – that provides low intrinsic noise and can be patterned at wafer scale.  
2. **Functionalize the channel with a highly specific recognition layer** – either a **molecularly imprinted COF monolayer** (for ultra‑dense, template‑specific cavities) or a **nano‑MIP/aptamer hybrid** (for dual‑mode verification).  
3. **Incorporate plasmonic or optical amplification** – Au‑nanostars, MXene‑AgNP composites, or an integrated SPR/FBG stack – to translate sub‑femtomolar binding events into measurable electrical or optical signals.  
4. **Deploy anti‑fouling/passivation strategies** (PEG‑silane, fluorosilane, conductive‑polymer intercalation) and **regeneration protocols** (voltage reversal, mild acid, supercritical CO₂) to ensure long‑term operation in real water or biological matrices.  
5. **Leverage scalable manufacturing** (roll‑to‑roll coating, ink‑jet printing, HF‑free MXene delamination) to keep per‑sensor cost below $1 while maintaining batch‑to‑batch uniformity (< 5 % thickness variation).  

When these elements are combined, **sub‑ppt detection limits (down to 0.12 fg L⁻¹ for PFOS) become attainable**, with **selectivity factors > 20** for individual PFAS species, **response times < 5 min**, and **sensor lifetimes exceeding six months** under continuous flow.  

**Which 2D nanomaterials or molecular probes are most promising?**  

* **For ultimate sensitivity and selectivity:** **β‑ketoenamine COF monolayers** imprinted with PFAS, coupled to a **high‑conductivity MXene (Ti₃C₂Tx) or graphene channel** and an **Au‑SPR/FBG optical stack**. This hybrid leverages the **dense imprint sites of COFs** and the **excellent carrier transport of MXenes/graphene**, while the optical components provide the necessary signal amplification and temperature compensation.  

* **For balanced performance and manufacturability:** **Graphene/MoS₂ heterostructures** functionalized with **nano‑MIPs and a small library of PFAS aptamers**, augmented by **Au‑nanostar/MXene‑AgNP plasmonic enhancers**. This configuration delivers **dual‑mode verification**, **on‑chip pre‑concentration**, and **high‑throughput printing**, making it ideal for field‑deployable sensor arrays.  

* **For sustainability and rapid response:** **Fluorosilane‑passivated MXene‑AgNP composites** integrated directly as the FET channel, exploiting **electrosorptive capture** and **voltage‑reversal regeneration**. Although current data on long‑term cycling are limited, the **low‑energy, HF‑free synthesis** and **high uptake capacity (≈ 50 mg g⁻¹)** position MXenes as a compelling platform for large‑scale water‑treatment monitoring.  

In summary, **the convergence of 2D COFs, graphene/MoS₂ heterostructures, and MXenes—each functionalized with molecularly imprinted polymers or aptamers and reinforced by plasmonic/optical amplification—constitutes the most promising pathway toward highly sensitive, selective, and scalable PFAS FET sensors**. Future work should focus on **integrating these components into a monolithic FET architecture**, **validating long‑term performance in real matrices**, and **finalizing life‑cycle assessments** to ensure both technical excellence and environmental responsibility.
