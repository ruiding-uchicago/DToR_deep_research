## 1. Introduction  

The rapid rise of carbon‑dioxide monitoring in industrial, environmental, and biomedical contexts demands sensors that can detect CO₂ at sub‑ppm (ideally sub‑ppb) levels, discriminate it from ubiquitous interferents such as O₂ and H₂O, respond within seconds, and retain calibration over months‑to‑years. Two‑dimensional (2‑D) nanomaterials—graphene and its derivatives, transition‑metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and MXenes—have emerged as the most promising platforms because of their atomically thin geometry, high surface‑to‑volume ratio, and tunable electronic/chemical surface chemistry.

Three recent research “branches” have explored complementary routes to maximise CO₂‑sensing performance:

| Branch | Core Material(s) | Main Strategy |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **A. Defect‑Engineered MXenes** | Ti₃C₂Tₓ (dual‑vacancy), Nb₂CTₓ, V₂CTₓ‑S | Vacancy creation, surface‑termination control, ultra‑thin Al₂O₃ passivation, scalable hydrothermal synthesis |
| **B. TMD / N‑Doped Graphene Heterostructures** | Pyridinic‑N‑doped graphene (ND‑G) + metallic‑phase 1T′ MoS₂/WS₂ | Vertical stacking with controlled twist, roll‑to‑roll (R2R) production, ALD encapsulation |
| **C. MIP‑Functionalised Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs)** | N‑doped GQDs + CO₂‑molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) (fluorescent) + MXene chemi‑resistive base | Molecular imprinting for selectivity, dual‑mode (fluorescence + resistance) read‑out, printable inks |

The present report integrates the findings from these three branches, evaluates their relative merits, resolves contradictions, and highlights novel candidate materials that could push CO₂ sensing toward the single‑digit‑ppb regime in both gaseous and aqueous media.

## 2. Synthesised Findings  

### 2.1 Performance Benchmarks Across Platforms  

| Platform | Detection Limit (LOD) | Selectivity (CO₂ : O₂ / CO₂ : H₂O) | Response / Recovery (s) | Long‑Term Stability* |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Dual‑vacancy Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene** (defect‑engineered, 1 nm Al₂O₃) | 10–30 ppb (gas) | >10³ : 1 vs O₂, >10² : 1 vs H₂O | 2.8 s / 2.5 s | <5 % drift over 90 days at 90 % RH; >12 months under mixed‑gas ageing (partial oxidation noted) |
| **Nb₂CTₓ / V₂CTₓ‑S MXenes (theoretical)** | Predicted ≤1 ppb (DFT binding –0.9 eV) | Predicted >10⁴ : 1 vs O₂, >10³ : 1 vs H₂O | Expected <2 s (vacancy‑dominated) | No experimental data yet |
| **ND‑G / 1T′ MoS₂ (vertical heterostructure)** | 0.01 ppm (10 ppb) in water | >100 : 1 vs O₂, >100 : 1 vs H₂O (electrostatic gating) | 0.4 s / 0.8 s | <2 % drift/yr; >12 months with 1 nm Al₂O₃ encapsulation |
| **ND‑G / 1T′ WS₂ (twist‑engineered)** | Comparable (≈10 ppb) | Similar selectivity | 0.5 s / 0.9 s | Same as MoS₂ heterostructure |
| **MIP‑GQD fluorescence sensor** | 0.3 ppb (lab‑scale) | >10⁵ : 1 vs O₂/H₂O (imprinted cavities) | 0.9 s / 1.2 s | Baseline drift <1 % over 30 days (lab); long‑term (>6 mo) unknown |
| **MXene chemi‑resistive film (printed)** | 1 ppb (stable) | >10³ : 1 vs O₂, >10² : 1 vs H₂O (antioxidant‑stabilised) | 1.5 s / 1.8 s | <3 % drift over 6 months; UV/ozone degradation observed after 1 yr |
| **Hybrid MXene + MIP‑GQD bilayer** | Sub‑ppb (≈0.5 ppb) | Combined fluorescence + resistance selectivity >10⁴ : 1 | 0.8 s / 1.1 s | Drift <2 %/yr (dual‑mode) |

\*Stability figures refer to drift in baseline resistance or fluorescence intensity under continuous operation; “>12 months” indicates the longest reported ageing test.

### 2.2 Common Themes  

1. **Surface Defects & Vacancies Are Central** – Both MXene and TMD branches converge on the idea that engineered vacancies (Ti/C vacancies in Ti₃C₂Tₓ, sulfur vacancies in TMDs) dramatically increase CO₂ adsorption energy, lowering the detection limit.  

2. **Functional Termination Controls Selectivity** – Hydroxyl‑rich (‑OH) terminations on MXenes and pyridinic nitrogen sites on graphene provide preferential CO₂ binding while repelling O₂/H₂O through electrostatic or hydrogen‑bonding mismatches.  

3. **Ultra‑Thin Passivation Balances Protection and Kinetics** – A 1 nm Al₂O₃ atomic‑layer‑deposited (ALD) capping layer repeatedly appears as the optimal barrier: it blocks moisture and corrosive gases (SO₂, NOₓ) yet allows CO₂ diffusion with negligible kinetic penalty.  

4. **Hybrid/Multimodal Architectures Amplify Performance** – Combining a conductive MXene base (low‑noise chemi‑resistive read‑out) with a highly selective MIP‑GQD overlayer yields sub‑ppb detection while preserving fast response.  

5. **Scalable Manufacturing Is Feasible** – Hydrothermal batch synthesis of defect‑engineered MXenes, CVD/N‑doping of graphene, and R2R deposition of MXene inks have all demonstrated wafer‑scale or >150 m continuous production, a prerequisite for commercial IoT sensors.  

### 2.3 Structural / Chemical Modifications that Enhance Metrics  

| Modification | Effect on Metric | Representative Evidence |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Dual Ti/C vacancies (Ti₃C₂Tₓ)** | LOD ↓ to 10 ppb; response ↓ to 2.8 s | XPS mapping shows >80 % vacancy density; QCM diffusion confirms unchanged CO₂ permeability |
| **Amine‑bridge functionalisation (‑NH₂‑pyrene)** | LOD ↓ to single‑digit ppb; selectivity ↑ (CO₂ : O₂ >10⁴ : 1) | FTIR shows strong carbamate formation; sensor tests in 5 % CO₂/95 % N₂ |
| **Metallic‑phase 1T′ MoS₂/WS₂** | Conductivity ↑ → response ↓ to 0.4 s; selectivity ↑ via gating | Hall measurements reveal carrier density >10¹³ cm⁻²; electrochemical gating suppresses O₂ redox |
| **MIP imprinting (CO₂‑template polymer)** | Selectivity ↑ >10⁵ : 1; LOD ↓ to 0.3 ppb (fluorescence) | Imprinted cavities measured by BET (0.8 nm) match CO₂ kinetic diameter |
| **ALD Al₂O₃ (1 nm)** | Drift ↓ <5 %/90 days; moisture tolerance ↑ to 95 % RH | Accelerated ageing (85 °C/85 % RH) shows negligible capacitance change |

## 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution  

| Contradiction | Branch(s) Involved | Explanation / Resolution |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **“Dual‑vacancy Ti₃C₂Tₓ consistently reaches sub‑10 ppb in high humidity”** vs. **“Graphene‑MOF hybrids achieve comparable limits, questioning MXene exclusivity.”** | MXene (A) vs. Graphene‑MOF (mentioned in A) | Both platforms can reach ~10 ppb, but MXene retains stability under >90 % RH thanks of Al₂O₃ passivation, whereas MOF layers degrade hydrolytically, leading to drift >10 %/mo. Hence MXene is superior for long‑term humid operation, while graphene‑MOF may be viable for short‑term lab use. |
| **“1 nm Al₂O₃ does not impede CO₂ diffusion”** vs. **“Increasing Al₂O₃ beyond 1 nm markedly slows response, indicating a narrow optimal window.”** | MXene (A) vs. Heterostructure (B) | The consensus is that *exactly* 1 nm is the sweet spot; any deviation (±0.2 nm) introduces measurable kinetic penalties. Process control (ALD pulse timing) must therefore be tightly regulated. |
| **“Vacancy creation is the dominant factor for LOD improvement.”** vs. **“Molecular‑bridge amine functionalisation can further lower limits to single‑digit ppb, suggesting vacancy engineering alone is insufficient.”** | MXene (A) vs. MXene (A) (internal) | Both statements are true at different hierarchical levels: vacancies set the baseline adsorption energy, while amine bridges provide additional chemisorption sites that fine‑tune the binding energy, pushing LOD from ~10 ppb to ~3 ppb. The combined strategy yields the best performance. |
| **“Batch hydrothermal synthesis yields uniform vacancy densities suitable for wafer‑scale production.”** vs. **“Spatial mapping shows up to 20 % vacancy density variation across large substrates.”** | MXene (A) vs. MXene (A) (internal) | The discrepancy stems from measurement technique: bulk XPS averages over the whole wafer, masking local heterogeneity that high‑resolution STEM‑EELS reveals. Process optimisation (stirring speed, temperature uniformity) can reduce the variation to <5 %—still a manufacturing challenge but not a fundamental limitation. |
| **“Vertical MXene/TMD heterostructures achieve sub‑ppm detection with rapid response.”** vs. **“Interfacial charge‑transfer losses limit performance to 0.2 ppm.”** | MXene/TMD heterostructure (A) vs. Heterostructure (B) | Early prototypes suffered from poor interface cleaning, leading to trap states. Recent work employing in‑situ plasma cleaning and van‑der‑Waals transfer yields near‑ideal band alignment, restoring sub‑ppm (actually sub‑10 ppb) performance. The contradiction reflects a temporal evolution of the technology. |
| **“Thin Al₂O₃ passivation guarantees long‑term stability against SO₂/NOₓ poisoning.”** vs. **“Accelerated ageing reveals gradual vacancy oxidation under continuous SO₂ exposure.”** | MXene (A) vs. MXene (A) (internal) | Al₂O₃ blocks bulk diffusion of SO₂ but does not fully prevent surface adsorption at defect sites. Over months, a fraction of vacancies become oxidised, slightly reducing carrier density. Periodic mild plasma regeneration can restore performance, suggesting that passivation is necessary but not sufficient for indefinite stability. |
| **“ND‑G alone can achieve sub‑ppb detection in water.”** vs. **“ND‑G without metallic‑phase TMD yields LOD ≈0.1 ppm.”** | Heterostructure (B) vs. Heterostructure (B) (internal) | The gating effect of the metallic‑phase TMD dramatically amplifies the transduction signal. ND‑G provides the selective adsorption sites, but the TMD supplies the high carrier density needed for ultra‑low noise detection. Hence the combination is essential. |
| **“ALD Al₂O₃ encapsulation does not affect sensor response time.”** vs. **“Time‑resolved measurements show a 15 % increase in latency.”** | Heterostructure (B) vs. MXene (A) | The 15 % increase is observed for the ND‑G/TMD stack where the active channel lies directly beneath the Al₂O₃. In MXene sensors the conductive plane is on top of the Al₂O₃, so diffusion path is unchanged. The impact is therefore architecture‑dependent. |
| **“Janus MXenes inherently provide >80 : 1 humidity selectivity.”** vs. **“Baseline drift observed at 95 % RH without silane passivation.”** | MXene (A) vs. MXene (A) (internal) | Theoretical calculations assume ideal terminations (OₓFᵧ) and no water adsorption. In practice, surface hydroxyls can bind water, causing drift. Adding a silane (APTES) layer mitigates this, reconciling theory with experiment. |

**Overall Resolution:** Most contradictions arise from differences in device architecture, processing nuances, or the stage of technology development. When the experimental conditions are normalised (identical passivation thickness, comparable vacancy density, and consistent measurement environments), the data converge on a clear hierarchy: *defect‑engineered MXenes with controlled terminations* and *ND‑G/TMD vertical heterostructures* deliver the best combination of ultra‑low LOD, rapid kinetics, and long‑term stability. *MIP‑GQD fluorescence* offers the highest selectivity but remains limited by scalability and long‑term durability.

## 4. Unique Perspective Insights  

### 4.1 Defect‑Engineered MXenes (Branch A)  

* **Vacancy‑Centric Design:** Demonstrates that simultaneous Ti‑ and C‑vacancies create high‑energy adsorption sites, directly lowering LOD to the 10 ppb range.  
* **Scalable Hydrothermal Batch Production:** Shows wafer‑scale uniformity (>4‑inch) and roll‑to‑roll coating feasibility, a rare advantage among 2‑D sensors.  
* **ALD Al₂O₃ Passivation Strategy:** Introduces a quantitative diffusion model (still a gap) that balances moisture protection with CO₂ permeability.  
* **Predictive Theoretical Extension:** Nb₂CTₓ and V₂CTₓ‑S are identified as next‑generation candidates with sub‑ppb potential, guiding future experimental work.  

### 4.2 ND‑G / Metallic‑Phase TMD Heterostructures (Branch B)  

* **Electrostatic Gating via Metallic‑Phase TMD:** The 1T′ phase supplies a high density of carriers that amplify the signal from CO₂ adsorption on ND‑G, achieving sub‑ppb detection in water—a regime where most chemi‑resistive sensors fail.  
* **Twist‑Angle Engineering:** A controlled ~3° Moiré twist optimises interlayer coupling, shortening response time to <0.5 s.  
* **Roll‑to‑Roll Production with In‑Line Twist Alignment:** Demonstrates >150 m continuous fabrication with >94 % yield, addressing the scalability bottleneck of many lab‑scale heterostructures.  
* **Modular Functionalisation:** Shows that silane edge‑passivation, additional ALD layers, or substitution of WS₂ for MoS₂ can be performed without disrupting the R2R line, offering a flexible platform for application‑specific tuning.  

### 4.3 MIP‑Functionalised GQDs & Dual‑Mode Sensors (Branch C)  

* **Molecular Imprinting for Chemical Selectivity:** Provides a cavity size that matches CO₂ (≈0.8 nm), delivering >10⁵ : 1 selectivity—far exceeding what can be achieved by electronic gating alone.  
* **Dual‑Mode Read‑Out:** By coupling fluorescence (high selectivity) with resistance (low‑noise, fast kinetics), the architecture mitigates the individual weaknesses of each modality (fluorescence photobleaching, resistance drift).  
* **Printable MXene Inks with Antioxidants:** Introduces ascorbic‑acid‑based stabilisation that suppresses MXene oxidation during ink formulation and printing, a practical insight for large‑area sensor arrays.  
* **Hybrid Bilayer Architecture:** The combination of a MXene base and MIP‑GQD overlayer yields a sensor that inherits the best of both worlds—sub‑ppb LOD, fast response, and a built‑in self‑calibration via fluorescence reference.  

### 4.3 Cross‑Branch Contributions  

* **Environmental Compatibility:** MXene passivation and ND‑G/TMD gating both address aqueous environments, while MIP‑GQD excels in dry‑gas matrices.  
* **Selectivity vs. Stability Trade‑Off:** Branch C emphasises selectivity through imprinting, whereas Branch A and B achieve comparable selectivity via intrinsic surface chemistry and device architecture, but with far superior long‑term drift performance.  
* **Hybridisation Pathways:** All three branches converge on the idea that *layered* or *multimodal* designs can surpass the limits of any single material, providing a roadmap for next‑generation commercial sensors.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion  

The multi‑perspective analysis clarifies the state‑of‑the‑art in CO₂ sensing with 2‑D materials:

1. **Highest‑Performing Materials**  
   * *Defect‑engineered Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene* (dual Ti/C vacancies, hydroxyl‑rich terminations, 1 nm Al₂O₃ passivation) delivers a reliable LOD of 10–30 ppb in gaseous environments, maintains >10³ : 1 selectivity against O₂, and tolerates >90 % relative humidity with minimal drift.  
   * *Pyridinic‑N‑doped graphene / metallic‑phase 1T′ MoS₂ (or WS₂) vertical heterostructures* achieve the same LOD (≈10 ppb) in aqueous media, with an unprecedented response time of <0.5 s and >100 : 1 selectivity to both O₂ and H₂O, thanks to electrostatic gating and interlayer coupling.  

2. **Selectivity‑Centric Platform**  
   * *MIP‑functionalised GQDs* provide the strongest interferent rejection (>10⁵ : 1) and the lowest laboratory LOD (0.3 ppb) via molecular imprinting, but the technology is presently limited to small‑area, lab‑scale devices and shows insufficient long‑term durability in harsh environments.  

3. **Hybrid Strategies Offer the Best Trade‑Offs**  
   * A *dual‑mode* sensor that couples a MXene chemi‑resistive film with an MIP‑GQD fluorescent overlayer attains sub‑ppb detection, retains fast kinetics, and benefits from the intrinsic stability of MXenes. This architecture is the most promising route toward a commercial product that must operate continuously in mixed‑gas or aqueous conditions.  

4. **Novel Candidates for Future Exploration**  
   * *Nb₂CTₓ* and *V₂CTₓ‑S* MXenes, predicted by DFT to bind CO₂ with ≈‑0.9 eV, could push LOD below 1 ppb if scalable vacancy‑creation protocols are established.  
   * *Janus MXenes* (OₓFᵧ terminations) combined with silane passivation may deliver ultra‑high humidity selectivity while preserving electronic performance.  
   * *Twist‑engineered ND‑G/1T′ WS₂* offers a chemically identical alternative to MoS₂ with potentially lower synthesis temperature, expanding the material palette for flexible substrates.  

**Take‑away Message:** When CO₂ sensing must operate in complex, humid, or aqueous environments, the *defect‑engineered MXene* family and the *ND‑G/metallic‑phase TMD heterostructure* family currently provide the most balanced performance—sub‑10 ppb detection, sub‑second response, and multi‑month stability—while *MIP‑GQD fluorescence* remains the benchmark for selectivity. The convergence of defect engineering, surface termination control, ultra‑thin passivation, and scalable R2R manufacturing creates a clear pathway toward commercial, low‑cost, IoT‑compatible CO₂ sensors capable of meeting the stringent requirements of next‑generation carbon‑management networks.
