### 1. Introduction  

Carbon dioxide (CO₂) monitoring is critical for environmental stewardship, industrial process control, and indoor air quality management. Conventional sensing technologies (infrared, chemiluminescence, metal‑oxide semiconductors) often suffer from high power consumption, limited selectivity, or poor performance in humid or mixed‑gas matrices. Two‑dimensional (2‑D) materials—graphene derivatives, transition‑metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MXenes, and emerging 2‑D perovskites—offer atomically thin active layers, tunable surface chemistry, and high surface‑to‑volume ratios that can be harnessed for highly sensitive, rapid, and selective CO₂ detection.

The present report integrates three independent research branches that explore distinct 2‑D material platforms:

1. **TMD–MOF Hybrid Membranes** – Combining MoS₂, WS₂, WSe₂ with metal‑organic frameworks (MOFs) to create porous, defect‑engineered membranes for gas‑phase CO₂ sensing.  
2. **Heteroatom‑Doped MXene–Graphene Hybrids** – Co‑doping Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXenes with P/B or N/S and integrating them with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to enhance CO₂ adsorption and electronic transduction.  
3. **Electrochemical CO₂ Detection with 2‑D Perovskite/MXene Electrodes** – Employing functionalized MXene scaffolds and 2‑D perovskite layers in aqueous electrolytes to achieve sub‑ppm detection limits.

The overarching research question is: *Which 2‑D materials, alone or in hybrid form, deliver the highest CO₂ sensing performance in complex gas or aqueous environments, and how do they compare in terms of detection limit, selectivity, response/recovery time, and long‑term stability?*  

This report synthesizes the findings, resolves apparent contradictions, highlights unique contributions, and presents a consolidated candidate inventory.

| 2 | P/B‑co‑doped Ti₃C₂Tₓ/graphene | ≤1 | <30 (resp.), <45 (rec.) | High vs H₂O, moderate vs O₂ | >30 days | Heteroatom‑induced active sites | Limited long‑term data |
| 3 | Ti₃C₂Tₓ/2‑D perovskite (electrochemical) | 0.04 | <10 (resp.), <20 (rec.) | >95 % vs O₂/H₂O | >30 days | Electrochemical transduction, aqueous compatibility | Aqueous‑only operation |

#### 2.1 Common Themes  

1. **Hybridization Enhances Performance** – Combining a 2‑D material with a porous scaffold (MOF, graphene, perovskite) consistently improves CO₂ adsorption kinetics and electrical transduction.  
2. **Defect & Heteroatom Engineering** – Introducing vacancies (S in MoS₂) or heteroatoms (P/B, N/S) increases CO₂ binding energy (–0.25 eV to –0.65 eV) while reducing water affinity, thereby boosting selectivity.  
3. **Hydrophobic Functionalization** – Hydrophobic MOFs (MOF‑804) or surface terminations (–OH vs –F) mitigate humidity interference, preserving response in 90 % RH environments.  
4. **Rapid Response/Recovery** – Most platforms achieve sub‑10 s response and <50 s recovery, meeting the demands of real‑time monitoring.  
5. **Long‑Term Stability** – While many studies report >30 days stability, only the TMD–MOF hybrid has not yet demonstrated >6 months data; further durability studies are needed.

#### 2.2 Quantitative Highlights  

- **Detection Limits**: The electrochemical perovskite/MXene platform achieves the lowest LOD (0.04 ppm), followed by the TMD–MOF hybrid (0.1–0.5 ppm) and MXene–graphene hybrids (≤1 ppm).  
- **Selectivity**: All platforms report >95 % selectivity against O₂ and H₂O, with the TMD–MOF hybrid showing the highest resilience to humidity due to hydrophobic MOF integration.  
- **Response/Recovery**: The 1T@2H MoS₂ with S vacancies delivers the fastest response (7 s) among solid‑state sensors, while the electrochemical platform offers the fastest recovery (<20 s).  
- **Stability**: Electrochemical sensors maintain >90 % of initial sensitivity after 30 days in 0.1 M NaOH, whereas MXene–graphene hybrids show <5 % drift over the same period.

### 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution  

| Contradiction | Source | Resolution / Explanation |
|---------------|--------|--------------------------|
| **MOF‑71 alone vs hybrid response** | TMD–MOF branch | MOF‑71 alone exhibits a 30 s response at 20 °C, whereas integration with MoS₂ reduces it to 10 s. The hybrid architecture provides additional adsorption sites and faster charge transfer pathways, explaining the improvement. |
| **Humidity effect on CO₂ adsorption** | TMD–MOF vs MXene–graphene branches | Some reports claim humidity increases CO₂ adsorption via water‑mediated pore expansion, while hydrophobic MOF‑804 reduces water uptake by ~70 % at 90 % RH. The discrepancy arises from differing MOF chemistries: hydrophilic vs hydrophobic frameworks. |
| **Pulse‑bias gating necessity** | TMD–MOF branch | One claim suggests pulse‑bias gating is unnecessary for drift mitigation, whereas another shows it reduces baseline drift from >5 % to <0.5 % over 12 h at 50 % RH. The latter indicates that in humid environments, gating is beneficial for maintaining baseline stability. |
| **Detection limit of MXene hybrids** | MXene–graphene branch | While some studies report sub‑ppm LOD for P/B‑co‑doped hybrids, others claim only ~5 ppm for N‑ or S‑doped variants. The difference is attributed to the specific heteroatom combination and doping density; P/B co‑doping yields stronger Lewis basic sites. |
| **Long‑term stability data** | All branches | Only the TMD–MOF hybrid lacks >6 month data; other platforms report >30 days. The lack of long‑term data for the hybrid is a gap rather than a contradiction. |

**Resolution Strategy**  
- **Framework Selection**: Choose hydrophobic MOFs (e.g., MOF‑804) when operating under high humidity.  
- **Defect Control**: Standardize defect densities (e.g., 5 % S vacancies) to ensure reproducibility.  
- **Bias Management**: Implement pulse‑bias gating in humid or mixed‑gas environments to suppress drift.  
- **Doping Optimization**: Prioritize P/B co‑doping for MXene–graphene hybrids to achieve sub‑ppm LOD.  
- **Long‑Term Testing**: Conduct ≥6 month stability studies for all hybrid platforms.

#### 4.3 Electrochemical CO₂ Detection with 2‑D Perovskite/MXene Electrodes  
- **Sub‑ppm Sensitivity**: DPV and SWV detect CO₂ at 0.04 ppm in 0.1 M NaOH, surpassing most solid‑state sensors.  
- **Charge‑Transfer Enhancement**: Surface functionalization (–OH, –O, –F, –Cl) reduces charge‑transfer resistance from 0.9 Ω cm² to 0.3 Ω cm², accelerating kinetics.  
- **Oxygen‑Vacancy Engineering**: Increasing O‑V density linearly boosts adsorption rate and peak current, offering a tunable parameter.  
- **Scalable Deposition**: Roll‑to‑roll ink fabrication yields >95 % electrical continuity and preserves >90 % MXene surface area.

### 5. Comprehensive Conclusion  

Across the three research branches, **hybrid architectures**—whether TMD–MOF, MXene–graphene, or perovskite–MXene—consistently outperform single‑phase 2‑D materials in CO₂ sensing. The key performance drivers are:

1. **Enhanced Surface Chemistry** – Defect engineering (S vacancies, O‑Vs) and heteroatom doping (P/B, N/S) create strong Lewis basic sites that preferentially bind CO₂ over H₂O and O₂.  
2. **Porous Scaffolds** – MOFs and graphene provide high surface area and rapid diffusion pathways, reducing response times to sub‑10 s.  
3. **Hydrophobic Functionalization** – Hydrophobic MOFs or surface terminations mitigate humidity interference, maintaining selectivity in 90 % RH environments.
