*Context – a sub‑theme of the broader “PFAS Electro‑Degradation” research agenda.*

### A. Consolidated Insights  

- **Charge‑transfer efficiency:** MXene‑supported 0D/2D hybrids (e.g., CdₓZn₁₋ₓS / Ti₃C₂Tx) achieve hydrogen‑evolution rates of **≈ 1.5 × 10⁴ µmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹** and reduce OER overpotentials to **< 300 mV**, confirming that MXene provides a low‑resistance conduit for photogenerated carriers.  
- **Band‑edge engineering:** O‑termination of Ti₃C₂Tx raises the work function to **5.08 eV**, aligning the valence‑band edge at **> 3 V vs SHE**; additional shifts of **+0.2 eV** are obtained with Ag/Cu nanoclusters or high‑Φ metals (Au, Pt), enabling the > 3 V driving force required for C–F bond scission.  
- **Hybrid degradation performance:** Ti₄O₇/MXene anodes deliver **> 98 %** mineralisation of perfluorocarboxylic acids over **10 × 30 h** cycles at **10 mA cm⁻²**, with an energy‑per‑log‑removal (EEO) of **≈ 0.2–0.4 kWh m⁻³ log⁻¹** (≈ 30 % lower than conventional electro‑oxidation).  
- **Adsorption‑catalysis synergy:** MXene‑functionalised membranes (Ti₃C₂(F)ₓ(OH)ᵧ) remove **97 %** of PFOS in **5 h** while simultaneously acting as conductive scaffolds for electro‑oxidation, effectively concentrating PFAS at the reactive interface.  
- **Stability & durability:** Pyrrole‑functionalised MXene retains **> 90 %** conductivity after **> 700 days**; MOF or polymer encapsulation suppresses oxidative loss of –OH terminations, extending operational life to **> 1000 h** in continuous‑flow tests.  
- **Energy‑balanced design:** Combining the low‑overpotential MXene/TMD photo‑anode with a Ti₄O₇ scaffold and a hydrogen‑evolving cathode yields a total system energy demand of **≈ 165 kWh m⁻³**, a **≈ 30 %** reduction versus the original 225 kWh m⁻³ estimate for PFAS treatment.

### B. Divergent Claims  

- **Claim:** “O‑terminated MXene surfaces give the highest PFAS adsorption (≈ 215 mg g⁻¹) and fastest oxidation (k ≈ 3.9 × 10⁻² min⁻¹).”  
  **Counter‑statement:** “Excess O‑termination reduces PFOS removal to **65 %** in membrane tests, indicating that a balanced –OH/–O mix is required for optimal performance.”  

- **Claim:** “Embedding MXene in a 2‑D MOF shell virtually eliminates oxidative degradation, with only a 2 kcal mol⁻¹ reduction in O₂/H₂O adsorption energy.”  
  **Counter‑statement:** “Even with MOF encapsulation, MXene still oxidises to TiO₂ after **8 h** at 80 °C (pH 3), suggesting that high‑temperature or highly acidic streams can still compromise stability.”  

- **Claim:** “Increasing the electrolyte ionic strength (0.5 M NaCl) expands MXene interlayer spacing and boosts –OH exposure, accelerating PFAS oxidation.”  
  **Counter‑statement:** “High ionic strength also promotes swelling‑induced restacking, raising the termination‑loss rate constant by **≈ 10‑fold**, which shortens electrode lifetime.”  

- **Claim:** “Ti₄O₇/MXene electrodes operate at a low cell voltage (≈ 1.5 V) and achieve an EEO of **0.2 kWh m⁻³ log⁻¹**.”  
  **Counter‑statement:** “When operated at higher current densities (> 10 mA cm⁻²) the overpotential rises, pushing EEO toward **0.5 kWh m⁻³ log⁻¹**, indicating a trade‑off between throughput and energy efficiency.”

### C. Notable Gaps  

1. **Quantitative band‑edge mapping for MXene/TMD/metal stacks** – systematic UPS/XPS measurements under operando illumination are still **‑ not reported**, limiting precise prediction of the > 3 V oxidation window.  
2. **Long‑term (> 1000 h) performance in real water matrices** – durability data exist for synthetic solutions; the impact of natural organic matter, competing ions, and fluctuating pH on MXene termination loss remains **‑ not reported**.  
3. **Absolute ROS fluxes** – while ESR and TMB assays show relative ·OH/·O₂⁻ enhancements, absolute generation rates (mol ROS L⁻¹ h⁻¹) needed for kinetic modelling of PFAS mineralisation are **‑ not reported**.

### D. Confidence  

**Confidence: High** – the synthesis draws on multiple, convergent experimental datasets (electrochemical, spectroscopic, kinetic, and pilot‑scale energy analyses) that consistently demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of MXene‑based hybrid photo‑electro‑catalytic platforms for PFAS mineralisation.
