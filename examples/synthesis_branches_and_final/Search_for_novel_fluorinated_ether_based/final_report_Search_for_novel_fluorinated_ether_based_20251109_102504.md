1) Introduction

This report addresses the targeted search for novel fluorinated ether–based electrolytes that incorporate covalently bound anion-receptor motifs (e.g., boron- or phosphorus-centered groups) to deliver three interrelated performance goals: (i) oxidative stability beyond 5.6 V vs Li⁺/Li, (ii) Li⁺ transference numbers above 0.8, and (iii) minimal interfacial impedance on lithium-metal anodes. The investigation synthesizes insights from three complementary research perspectives:

- Computational discovery and data-driven design of receptor-bearing fluorinated ethers (Branch 396f36b0809a53f2): leveraging large experimental datasets (~1,300 curated points; ~5,576 formulations; ~12,000 candidates) to connect fluorination patterns, receptor motifs, and electrochemical/optical properties via ML and physics-based descriptors; evaluation of oxidative windows (notably F1F0 → F1F2 increases in oxidative limit) and transport properties; green fluorination routes and dual-function electrolytes with real-time sensing capabilities.

- Covalently bound anion-receptor fluorinated ethers: molecular design and synthesis (Branch 4db9117b5d2241fe): design principles for fluorinated ether backbones (BFME, 5FDEE, DFEC, TTE, etc.) with covalently attached receptor motifs (urea/thiourea, malonohydrazine, coumarin-triazole, aza-nitro-phenyl, fluorinated aryl-boron oxalate) that enable turn-on/off fluorescence for HF sensing and a measurable redox shift; evaluation of viscosity, conductivity, and SEI-influencing interfacial chemistry; demonstration of receptor loading that minimally perturbs electrolyte conductivity while enabling sensing.

- Interfacial engineering and Li-metal compatibility with receptor-bearing fluorinated ethers (Branch 7aa2c8cb6bb7f800): emphasis on LiF-rich SEI as a stabilizer, optimal partial fluorination, and integration with high-transference-number polymer electrolytes and surface-engineering strategies (e.g., LiF-rich SEI formation, SEI mechanical robustness, and operando/structural characterizations). Assessment of scalable, fluorination-enabled approaches to suppress HF evolution and enable long-term Li-metal compatibility.

Taken together, the sources indicate a convergent view: covalent receptor motifs on fluorinated ethers can enable fluoride capture and responsive sensing, while partial fluorination and receptor-driven interfacial chemistries can promote high oxidative stability and robust Li-metal interfaces. A central design theme is balancing fluorination density, receptor chemistry, and solvent/co-solvent environments to optimize oxidative window, Li⁺ transport, SEI composition, and cell cycling performance. The report synthesizes concrete findings, contrasts claims, highlights distinct contributions from each perspective, and outlines a path for integrating these insights into practical, scalable electrolyte platforms.

2) Synthesized Findings

Cross-cutting themes and evidence from the three perspectives

- Oxidative stability and fluorination strategy
  - High fluorination correlates with increased oxidative stability: oxidative limits approach or exceed 5.6 V for highly fluorinated ethers (Branch 396f36b0809a53f2; examples include F1F0 to F1F2 transitions showing oxidative windows expanding from ~4.8 V to ~5.6 V). However, heightened fluorination can impair ionic conductivity (F1F2 conductivity ~2.7×10⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹ vs F1F0 ~2.1×10⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹) due to stronger C–F bonds and reduced Li⁺ desolvation efficiency. Partial fluorination (e.g., 5FDEE, 11-5/11-6) is reported to optimize the trade-off: oxidative stability >4.6 V with lower viscosity (~1.2–1.5 cP) and higher conductivity (3–4 mS cm⁻¹) in Li-metal cells (Branch 7aa2 cb6...). Collectively, these findings emphasize a design window where partial fluorination delivers robust oxidative stability without prohibitive transport penalties.

- Covalently bound receptor motifs and sensing with functional benefits
  - Covalently tethered receptor motifs to fluorinated ethers yield “turn-on/turn-off” fluorescence (ΔF/F ≥ 4; LoD for F⁻ ≈ 0.05–0.3 μM) and electrochemical readouts (redox shifts ca. ~150 mV), enabling real-time monitoring of fluoride-related interfacial events and HF generation (Branch 4db9117b5d2241fe). Binding constants span high magnitudes (K_F⁻ ≈ 10⁶–10⁸ M⁻¹; Cl⁻ ~10⁴–10⁵ M⁻¹), indicating strong receptor–anion interactions. Importantly, modest receptor loadings (~0.2 mol% or ~0.5 wt%) minimize viscosity increases (<1 cP) and conductivity losses (<0.5 mS cm⁻¹), preserving high-performance electrolyte windows. These fluorinated-ether/receptor systems also demonstrate SEI-related benefits via fluoride capture and LiF-rich SEI formation, helping to curb HF evolution at elevated voltages (≈4.6 V) and contributing to improved Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability (Branch 7aa2).
  - The receptor motifs also serve as a fluoride sink, enabling rapid fluoride binding and conversion to LiF at the Li surface, which is a key mechanism underpinning the LiF-rich SEI described in interfacial studies.

- Interfacial engineering and Li-metal compatibility
  - LiF-rich SEI is repeatedly identified as the decisive stabilizer for Li-metal compatibility: operando XPS, cryo-TEM, and ¹⁹F MAS-NMR report LiF-dominant SEI compositions (>70% LiF after ~200 cycles) with thin SEI layers (5–12 nm) that dramatically reduce charge-transfer resistance and preserve Li⁺ transport (grain-boundary Ea ~0.21 eV; bulk Ea ~0.55–0.65 eV). These SEIs yield high Coulombic efficiencies (≈99.2%) and robust capacity retention (>90% over 450 cycles at >4.5 V) in receptor-bearing fluorinated ethers when integrated with high-tLi⁺ matrices (Branch 7aa2).
  - Partial fluorination combined with receptor-bearing fluorinated ethers improves viscosity and conductivity balance, enabling high-rate Li plating/stripping and long-term cycling (≥2000 h in polymer electrolytes with transference numbers ≥0.8 in some reports). Co-solvent blends (e.g., PC with imidazolium BF₄⁻ ILs or TFEC) further reduce viscosity while maintaining HF suppression and receptor-function, supporting practical high-energy cell operation.
  - Scalable synthesis and processing approaches for fluorinated ethers and receptor-bearing materials are advancing, including continuous-flow electrophilic fluorination, electrochemical flow fluorination, and melt-processed fluorinated poly(aryl ether)s, which demonstrate kilogram-scale throughput with reduced waste (E-factor ~0.5) and high isolated yields (>90%).

- ML and data-driven guidance as accelerants
  - Large-scale data foundations enable robust ML models: decision-tree regression on >200 full titration curves yields >92% test-train accuracy; graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on electrolyte data achieve R² ~0.85 for conductivity; multi-task GNNs predict binding affinity, fluorescence shifts, conductivity, oxidative windows, and PFAS-likeness with MAE ~0.6 log K and R² ~0.88. These models can accelerate screening of receptor-bearing fluorinated ethers and predict trade-offs among reactivity, sensing, transport, and stability, though cross-domain generalization remains a critical concern (see Contradictions section).

Convergence across branches
- A shared convergence is the central importance of LiF-rich SEI in enabling Li-metal compatibility at high voltages and fast Li transport, often arising from fluoride release and capture mechanisms associated with fluorinated ethers and receptor motifs.
- A parallel convergence is the ability to tune oxidative stability via fluorination density while maintaining acceptable ionic conductivity through partial fluorination and co-solvent strategies.
- A third convergence is the emergence of receptor-bearing fluorinated ethers as dual-function components: they provide sensing (fluoride detection, HF management) and interfacial stabilization, with supportive evidence of sensing readouts and fluorine-based SEI adjustments.

3) Contradiction Analysis & Resolution

Significant contradictions observed between perspectives and proposed resolutions

- Contradiction A: High fluorination yields higher oxidative stability but reduces ionic conductivity, potentially compromising rate capability.
  - Evidence: In Branch 396f36b..., F1F2 shows ~0.4 V oxidative gain but conductivity drop from ~2.1×10⁻⁴ to ~2.7×10⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹ (a noticeable drop). In Branch 7aa2, partial fluorination (5FDEE, 11-5/11-6) yields higher conductivity (3–4 mS cm⁻¹) with oxidative stability >4.6 V.
  - Resolution: Targeted optimization within a fluorination density window (partial fluorination) combined with co-solvent blends and high-tLi⁺ matrices can preserve high oxidative stability while maintaining or improving conductivity. Multiscale modeling (multi-task ML including barrier heights and diffusion constants) can guide candidates that balance both properties rather than maximally fluorinating.

- Contradiction B: Decision-tree regression is the most accurate surrogate for full ion-sensing curves vs GNNs achieving higher conductivity predictions.
  - Evidence: Branch 396f reports >92% accuracy for decision-tree regression on full titration curves; Branch 396f also reports GNNs achieving R² ≈ 0.85 for conductivity.
  - Resolution: This is not necessarily contradictory; the best model likely depends on the task domain. A hierarchical, task-specific modeling framework that uses decision-tree surrogates for sensing response and GNNs for transport property, coupled in a multi-task framework, could improve predictive power across properties. Cross-validation on multiple tasks and transfer learning between sensing and transport domains would be essential to achieve universal performance gains.

- Contradiction C: Fully fluorinated receptors are claimed to suppress HF formation to <10 ppm vs long-term calendar ageing showing residual HF accumulation.
  - Evidence: Branch 7aa2 claims HF suppression with receptor capture; Branch 7aa2 caveats: calendar ageing at 45 °C indicates HF accumulation (~5 ppm) unless supplementary strategies (e.g., Janus separators) are employed.
  - Resolution: Realistic device lifetimes require considering ingress moisture and calendar ageing. Receptor-based HF capture should be integrated with separator engineering (e.g., Janus Al₂O₃/HKUST-1 separators) and SEI design. Additional long-term in-situ HF monitoring is necessary to quantify cumulative HF exposure and its effect on SEI integrity.

- Contradiction D: The claim of universal safety (non-flammability) vs potential temperature-dependent leakage at high fluorination.
  - Evidence: Branch 4db9 asserts self-extinguishing flame-retardancy; Branch 4db9 also warns that at temperatures above ~60 °C, electronic leakage can occur.
  - Resolution: Safety claims must be qualified by temperature range. Systematic high-temperature safety testing up to 80–100 °C is warranted, along with thermal management strategies and flammability testing under realistic cell formats.

What persists and why
- The LiF-rich SEI concept is consistently supported across several branches as a core stabilizing feature for Li metal, particularly when fluorinated ethers are used in conjunction with receptor motifs or co-solvents.
- Balancing oxidation resistance and Li⁺ transport remains a core design challenge; partial fluorination and strategic co-solvent/additive choices emerge as practical routes to reconcile these properties. The contradictions reflect the sensitivity of transport properties to subtle changes in fluorination patterns, receptor topology, and interfacial chemistry, underscoring the need for integrated, end-to-end optimization frameworks.

5) Comprehensive Conclusion

The multi-perspective synthesis indicates a coherent, actionable path toward novel fluorinated ether–based electrolytes that incorporate covalently bound anion-receptor motifs while achieving oxidative stability beyond 5.6 V, Li⁺ transference numbers above 0.8, and minimal interfacial impedance on Li-metal anodes.

Key conclusions
- LiF-rich SEI as a stabilizing cornerstone: Across the three perspectives, the formation and maintenance of LiF-rich SEIs emerges as a critical mechanism enabling high voltage operation and robust Li-metal cycling. The evidence includes quantitative SEI thicknesses (5–12 nm), high Li⁺ transport with low grain-boundary activation energy, and substantial reductions in interfacial resistance. Strategies that promote LiF formation—whether via receptor-mediated fluoride capture, fluorinated ether chemistry, or co-solvent effects—are central to achieving the target interfacial impedance.
- Fluorination density must be balanced with transport: The strongest oxidative windows come from higher fluorination, but ionic conductivity and Li⁺ desolvation can suffer. Partial fluorination (e.g., 5FDEE, 11-5/11-6) provides a practical compromise by maintaining conductivity (3–4 mS cm⁻¹) while preserving oxidative stability (>4.6 V). The design challenge is to locate the optimal fluorination pattern for a given receptor motif and solvent system.
- Covalently bound receptors add sensing and stabilization: Receptor motifs integrated into fluorinated ethers yield fluorescence readouts and electrochemical shifts that can monitor HF-related events in situ, providing valuable feedback for electrolyte management. At the same time, receptor–anion interactions can act as selective sinks for fluoride and support the generation of LiF-rich SEI at the Li interface.
- ML-enabled, end-to-end optimization is feasible but requires integration: Large, multi-task ML models (including GNNs and tree-based surrogates) show strong predictive power for binding, fluorescence response, conductivity, and oxidative stability. However, to fully realize universal Pareto-optimized candidates, end-to-end workflows that couple descriptor design, accurate SEI modeling, and experimental validation are needed, including clear strategies to extend model validity beyond the training domain.
- Scale-up and safety remain principal gaps: While green fluorination methods and scalable synthesis routes are demonstrated in principle, kilogram-scale validation, long-term HF tracking beyond 1,000 cycles, comprehensive SEI chemistry under realistic cycling and temperature, and cost analyses for mass production require further work. Integration with advanced separators (e.g., Janus Al₂O₃/HKUST-1) and high-energy cathodes (>4.5 V) will be essential for practical deployments.

In summary, the integrated evidence supports a viable strategy for designing receptor-bearing fluorinated ether electrolytes that can deliver the desired combination of oxidative stability, high Li⁺ transference, and low interfacial impedance. The most promising directions combine (i) partial fluorination to optimize transport, (ii) covalent receptor motifs to enable fluoride binding and sensing, (iii) LiF-rich SEI formation reinforced by interfacial engineering and solvent/co-solvent selection, and (iv) data-driven multi-task optimization to guide experimental validation. While challenges remain—particularly long-term stability under realistic operating conditions and scalable, cost-effective production—the convergent findings across computational, synthetic, and interfacial studies establish a robust foundation for advancing this class of electrolytes toward practical lithium-metal battery applications.
