Title: Integrated Perspective on Membrane Materials for Selective Li⁺, Co²⁺, and Ni²⁺ Separation from Aqueous Solutions

1) Introduction

The challenge of selectively separating lithium ions (Li⁺) from multivalent transition-metal ions such as cobalt(II) and nickel(II) in aqueous feeds is central to sustainable resource recovery from brines, battery leachates, and seawater-like streams. The goal is to leverage selective transport properties—tailored pore sizes, specific surface functionalizations, and charge affinities—to achieve high selectivity (Li⁺ vs. Co²⁺/Ni²⁺ and Li⁺ vs. other ions) while maintaining practical water flux (permeability) and robust chemical/mechanical stability. The three branches summarized here provide complementary visions for this objective:

- Branch 23f76ceda31d1ebe (Polymeric membranes functionalized with crown ethers and charged moieties): emphasizes molecular-size–matched crown-ether cavities (12‑, 15‑, 18‑crown‑4/5/6) combined with fixed charges (quaternary ammonium, sulfonate, or polymer-bound anions) to realize tunable electrostatic and size-based selectivity. It highlights dual-gate architecture, high Li⁺ uptake, respectable water permeance, and strong fouling-control via bias, with durable performance in alkaline media and moderate regeneration tolerance. Notable gaps include a lack of a quantitative link between fixed-charge density and crown-ether binding strength, and limited long-term regeneration data.

- Branch 85f41ea2f48e7b9f (Inorganic nanoporous frameworks: zeolites, MOFs, LDHs): focuses on rigid, well-defined sub-nanometre pore architectures augmented by multilayer “double‑multiplying” sieving (e.g., zeolite top-coats on MOFs), conductive nanophases to enable electrochemical regeneration, surface-charge engineering via functionalization, and ion-specific functionalization to boost Li⁺ selectivity while rejecting multivalents. Reported selectivity values (Li⁺/Co²⁺/Ni²⁺ factors in the 30–60 range) are competitive, with durability projections and energy considerations underscored, though long-term continuous operation data in realistic brines remain limited.

- Branch eb8c30ec3e8c9721 (Hybrid 2D-material membranes: Graphene oxide (GO), MXene, and responsive interlayers): proposes stimuli-responsive interlayer spacing (chemical cross-linking, intercalants, photothermal and voltage cues) to actively modulate permeation, with GO–MXene laminates delivering high flux and strong rejection, and energy-efficient regeneration protocols that leverage electro-gating and reduced chemical usage. It also reports dramatic improvements in mechanical robustness and scalable manufacturing potential, yet notes gaps in long-term high-bias durability and multi-ion, real-brine testing.

This report synthesizes and integrates these perspectives to identify materials, design principles, and practical candidates anticipated to optimize selectivity and permeability for Li⁺, Co²⁺, and Ni²⁺ separations.

2) Synthesized Findings: Key Insights Across Branches

Convergent themes and supporting data

- Size-exclusion plus electrostatic selectivity as a robust dual mechanism:
  - Crown-ether–functionalized polymer membranes combine precise cavity sizes with fixed charges to create a dual gate. Reported Li⁺ selectivity factors in binary tests and multicomponent feeds range from 30–60× when charge density is ≥1 mmol g⁻¹, underscoring the power of size-sieving combined with Donnan-type exclusion. In an electrodialysis (ED) context, Li⁺ fluxes reached 22.6 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with a Li⁺/Mg²⁺ separation factor ≈ 872, illustrating how electrostatic effects can dramatically amplify selectivity in practical configurations.
  - Inorganic frameworks also deploy size-exclusion through precise pore architectures (sub-nanometre coatings, interlayer galleries) combined with surface charges. Positive nanolayers delivering Donnan exclusion can push multivalent rejection >99% and raise Li⁺ selectivity (Li⁺/Mg²⁺) to ~37–60, with relatively high water flux.

- Targeted functionalization for ion discrimination:
  - Crown ethers (12‑, 15‑, 18‑crown‑4/5/6; dibenzo variants) paired with charged backbones (quaternary ammonium polymers, sulfonated backbones) emphasize a tunable, chemistry-driven selectivity beyond simple size exclusion.
  - Inorganic approaches exploit surface functionalization (phosphonic acid grafting on zeolite 5A, Co-doping of ZIF‑8) to modulate binding energies and selectivity toward Li⁺ relative to Co²⁺/Ni²⁺ while preserving Li⁺ transport through narrow channels.
  - GO/MXene interlayers can be chemically or functionally cross-linked to yield interlayer spacings that respond to stimuli, effectively turning the membrane between high-flux and high-selectivity states on demand.

- Practical performance metrics demonstrating high potential:
  - Crown-ether polymer membranes show water permeance of 30–40 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹, Li⁺ uptake of 27–297 mg g⁻¹ (depending on polymer platform), and diffusion/flux metrics in the μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ range under ED operation. AC bias yields near-complete flux recovery (99.8–100%) for fouling challenges, with TMP growth halved versus DC operation.
  - Inorganic NP frameworks (e.g., ZIF-8 coatings on LDH and MOF/zeolite hybrids) deliver Li⁺ selectivity factors in the 30–60 range, with single-pass Li uptake around 80% in some configurations. Life-cycle considerations include high stability under repeated charge–discharge or cycling (e.g., 10,000 cycles with ~92.6% capacitance retention for some ZIF/LDH systems).
  - GO–MXene laminates demonstrate very high water flux (up to 420 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹ in certain formulations) with Li⁺ permeation at ≥80% of feed concentration and Li⁺/Co²⁺ selectivity of ~1.8–2.5; dye and ion rejection remain >95%. Regeneration energy can be significantly lower for electrochemical gating (≤0.2 kWh m⁻³) than for chemical elution (>1 kWh m⁻³).

- Fabrication, scalability, and operational resilience:
  - Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition on porous supports can yield comprehensive polymeric films 5 μm or thinner, with scalable roll-to-roll processes and thickness control; performance metrics (selectivity >40, uptake ~100 mg g⁻¹) are compatible with large-area manufacturing.
  - Roll-to-roll coating and interfacial polymerization approaches have shown promise for industrial-scale membranes, with demonstration of reproducible interlayer spacing and alignment via inline XRD/GISAXS feedback.

Key knowledge gaps that persist

- A quantitative, predictive model linking fixed-charge density (σ or mmol g⁻¹) to an effective crown-ether binding constant (K_eff) is missing. This constrains predictive design when moving from single‑ion to multicomponent brines.
- Long-term stability and lifecycle data in realistic Li⁺/Co²⁺/Ni²⁺ brines are sparse. Reported durability (e.g., >10,000 cycles) is often in controlled tests or in proxy systems; concrete data under industrial-typical regeneration cycles and brine chemistries remain limited.
- Real-world fouling, scaling, and multi-ion competition in seawater-like feeds or battery leachates require further study, particularly for GO/MXene systems where stability under bias and complex chemistries has not been exhaustively tested.
- Energy accounting and techno-economic analyses (TEA/LCA) for the proposed technologies are not consistently reported, making direct comparisons with conventional ion-exchange or desalination approaches challenging.

3) Contradiction Analysis & Resolution

Significant disparities or tensions arise in the literature summaries, and the following clarifications help resolve or contextualize them:

- Ultra-high Li⁺ selectivity claims (>10⁴ for crown-ether–functionalized membranes) versus observed experimental maxima (≈60 in binary Li⁺/Na⁺):
  - Resolution: The most extreme selectivity figures (e.g., >10⁴) are reported for crystal-channel membranes or idealized systems, not for polymeric, defect-prone, or pilot-scale membranes operating in realistic brines. Polymer films show substantially lower selectivity due to defects, non-idealization of binding equilibria, and multi-ion competition. The practical range (30–60×) appears robust across multiple polymeric systems.
- Claims of barrierless or indefinitely durable systems under high bias or continuous operation versus limited durability data:
  - Resolution: While bias-based fouling control and materials with cross-linked nanophases show impressive short-to-medium-term stability (hundreds to thousands of hours in tests), there is insufficient evidence of indefinite durability under industrial loads. The persistence of structural integrity under sustained high bias, especially in complex feeds, remains an active area for long-term studies.
- The assertion that fixed-charge density alone yields near-complete rejection of multivalent ions versus observed brine effects:
  - Resolution: Donnan exclusion and fixed-charge effects are highly effective but susceptible to concentration polarization and screening in high-salinity feeds. Real brines with competitive ions (Na⁺, Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, Fe³⁺) can erode idealized rejection performance, underscoring the need for combined mechanisms (size selectivity, charge density, and functionalization) and for careful feed management.

4) Unique Perspective Insights: What Each Branch Contributes

- Crown-ether–functionalized polymer membranes (Branch 23f76ceda31d1ebe):
  - Unique contribution: Demonstration of dual-gate selectivity combining precise crown-ether cavity sizes with permanent surface charges to achieve substantial Li⁺ discrimination. The combination yields high Li⁺ uptake and high apparent selectivity (30–60×) in both binary and multicomponent feeds, with practical metrics for water permeance, crosslinking stability, and fouling-resilient operation under bias. The use of LbL architectures and scalable fabrication (roll-to-roll) provides a practical path to industry uptake.
- Inorganic nanoporous frameworks (Branch 85f41ea2f48e7b9f):
  - Unique contribution: A design philosophy built on rigid, engineered pore architectures and multilayer sieving that compounds size-based selectivity with Donnan-like exclusion via surface charges. The potential to couple ion-selective capture with electrochemical regeneration (via embedded conductive phases) and the ability to engineer interlayer spacing and functionalization through well-defined MOFs/zeolites/LDHs distinguishes this branch. It presents clear routes for high selectivity and potential long lifetimes in cycle-stress environments.
- Hybrid 2D-material GO/MXene membranes (Branch eb8c30ec3e8c9721):
  - Unique contribution: A dynamic, stimuli-responsive approach to transport control, where interlayer spacing can be tuned by chemical, thermal, or electrochemical cues. The combination of GO’s mechanical robustness with MXene’s conductivity and tunable interlayer chemistry yields exceptional fluxes and notable energy advantages for regeneration. The inline, roll-to-roll fabrication paradigm and real-time spacing feedback offer a compelling path toward scalable, adaptive membranes for complex feeds.

5) Comprehensive Conclusion

Integrated assessment across crown-ether polymer membranes, inorganic nanoporous frameworks, and GO/MXene hybrid laminates points to a coherent set of design principles and promising materials for Li⁺, Co²⁺, and Ni²⁺ separation:

- The most robust strategy appears to be a dual-mechanism approach: (a) precise size-exclusion windows matched to Li⁺ (~0.76 Å hydrated radius) and multivalent cobalt/nickel ions (~0.90 Å hydrated radius) and (b) strong, selectively tuned charge interactions (fixed-charge density, Donnan exclusion) combined with tailored surface chemistry. Crown-ether–based polymers provide this dual gate in a chemically tunable format, achieving substantial Li⁺ selectivity while maintaining acceptable fluxes and fouling resilience. 
- Inorganic nanoporous frameworks offer the potential for even tighter control over pore dimensions and a more rigid, durable architecture that can withstand cycling and high salinity. The combination of MOF/zeolite/LDH hybrids with surface-charge engineering and fixed-pore constraints can deliver Li⁺ preference with high rejection of Co²⁺/Ni²⁺, plus durable regeneration pathways (electrochemical or chemical). The main challenges lie in long-term continuous operation, multi-ion brines, and scaled energy costs, which require further demonstration.
- Stimuli-responsive GO/MXene membranes introduce an attractive route to adaptive transport: the ability to modulate interlayer spacing on demand could allow membranes to switch between high-throughput filtration and high-selectivity separation, lowering energy costs for regeneration and enabling responsive brine processing. Real-world durability and multi-ion selectivity under continuous operation remain to be thoroughly demonstrated.

Practical guidance for material design and future research directions

- Develop quantitative models linking fixed-charge density to crown-ether binding constants (K_eff) to enable predictive design for multicomponent brines. This will enable rapid optimization of selectivity and uptake as feed composition changes.
- Pursue cascaded or hybrid architectures that combine size-exclusion, electrostatic selectivity, and functionalization with robust, regenerable backbones (e.g., crown-ether–functionalized polymers integrated with inorganic compact layers or MXene-based interlayers). Such hybrids may deliver higher apparent selectivity while preserving flux.
- Extend long-term testing to realistic, multi-ion brines under mixed-operation modes (DC, AC EMBR, voltage gating) and at industrially relevant temperatures and salinities. Collect data on ligand leaching, framework breathing (or its suppression), fouling dynamics, and cycle life beyond hundreds to thousands of hours.
- Emphasize scalable fabrication with consistent interlayer spacing control and minimal defect density. Validation of roll-to-roll processes with inline spacings feedback (XRD/GISAXS) will be critical to industrial adoption.
- Integrate life-cycle assessment and techno-economic analyses early in development to compare crown-ether–based, inorganic framework–based, and GO/MXene–based systems, factoring in synthesis energy, chemical usage, regeneration energy, and end-of-life considerations.

Final remarks

The integrated view indicates several promising directions. A practical path forward likely combines crown-ether–functionalized polymer films with inorganic, rigid interlayers or with GO/MXene interlayers that can be tuned via stimuli to balance flux and selectivity. Such hybrids could exploit fast, high-flux transport with robust selectivity via tuned pore environments, fixed charges, and dynamic interlayer spacing. Critical research milestones include developing a predictive K_eff model tied to fixed-charge density, compiling long-term performance data in realistic brines, and performing life-cycle and techno-economic analyses to compare crown-ether, inorganic framework, and GO/MXene approaches under industrial operating scenarios. A well-designed, multi-layer architecture that integrates selective binding (crown ethers or functionalized zeolites/MOFs), rigid size-exclusion filters, and adaptive interlayers (GO/MXene) offers the best prospect for achieving high Li⁺ recovery with concurrent Co²⁺ and Ni²⁺ rejection at industrial scales.
