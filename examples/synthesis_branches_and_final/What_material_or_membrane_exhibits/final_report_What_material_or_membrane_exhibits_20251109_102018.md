## 1. Introduction  

Lithium‑ion batteries, electric‑vehicle recycling, and the growing demand for lithium from brine resources have created an urgent need for membranes that can discriminate Li⁺ from the chemically similar Na⁺ ion. Both ions possess nearly identical hydrated radii (≈ 3.82 Å for Li⁺, 3.58 Å for Na⁺) and comparable solvation shells, which makes size‑based sieving ineffective. Traditional strategies rely on crown‑ether‑functionalised polymers that exploit subtle differences in complexation energy, yet their selectivity (typically 2–5 ×) and long‑term stability remain limited.

To identify **novel, breakthrough‑level candidates**, three independent research “branches” were examined:

| Branch | Core Concept | Representative Materials / Techniques |
|--------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| **A – Bioinspired Peptide‑Based Nanochannels** | Sub‑nanometre confinement combined with engineered acidic peptide pockets that mimic natural Li⁺‑selective transporters. | MXene or λ‑MnO₂ interlayers grafted with AI‑designed Asp/Glu‑rich peptides; stimulus‑responsive (voltage/pH) gating. |
| **B – Covalent‑Organic‑Framework (COF) Nanochannels** | Crystalline porous polymers bearing tunable Lewis‑acidic (hard‑acid) sites that preferentially bind Li⁺. | Cr³⁺‑oxo or Ti⁴⁺‑metalated β‑ketoenamine COFs (e.g., 4F‑COF/PP, 3D‑COF‑300) with post‑synthetic functionalisation. |
| **C – Defect‑Engineered 2D Materials** | Atom‑scale vacancies and edge‑functional groups create sub‑nanometre charged pores that combine steric exclusion with electrostatic repulsion. | Graphene‑oxide (GO) or MoS₂ laminates, nitrogen‑doped VO₀.₉, crown‑ether intercalated GO‑MoS₂ stacks, roll‑to‑roll plasma‑etched sheets. |

The following sections synthesize the quantitative performance metrics, reconcile divergent claims, and highlight the distinctive contributions of each perspective, ultimately answering which material class currently offers the highest Li⁺ / Na⁺ selectivity and why it is promising for scale‑up.

## 2. Synthesized Findings  

### 2.1 Convergent Design Principles  

| Principle | Evidence Across Branches |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Sub‑nanometre confinement (≈ 0.6–0.9 nm)** | Peptide‑grafted MXene slits (6.2 ± 0.1 Å) give Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 38; COF pore apertures 0.6–0.9 nm deliver Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 9–12; defect‑engineered GO/MoS₂ pores < 0.8 nm achieve γ ≈ 1 400–8 400 in single‑salt tests. |
| **Hard‑acidic coordination sites** | Cr³⁺‑oxo/Ti⁴⁺ nodes raise Li⁺ binding by 0.3–0.5 eV → Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 9–10; acidic Asp/Glu residues in peptides provide ΔΔG ≤ ‑2 kcal mol⁻¹ favouring Li⁺; negatively charged edge groups (‑COO⁻, ‑SO₃⁻) create an electrostatic barrier for Na⁺. |
| **Electrostatic repulsion / surface charge** | MXene‑peptide hybrids tuned to –0.2 → ‑0.5 e nm⁻² give Li⁺ transference tLi⁺ ≈ 0.77; COF membranes exhibit ζ ≈ ‑30 mV, yielding Li⁺ flux 0.12 mol m⁻² h⁻¹; GO/MoS₂ sheets with σ ≈ ‑0.10 C m⁻² reach Li⁺/Na⁺ > 10 : 1 even in 0.6 M brine. |
| **Stimuli‑responsive or tunable gating** | Peptide‑MXene channels switch selectivity on/off within 10 ms by ±1 V or pH 5→9; defect‑engineered GO membranes retain high selectivity after voltage‑induced charge modulation (0.30 V nm⁻¹ sufficient). |
| **Hybrid reinforcement for durability** | Inorganic overlayers (5–10 nm SiO₂, black‑phosphorene) protect peptide‑MXene membranes; COFs retain > 95 % Li⁺ uptake after 5 regeneration cycles; GO‑MoS₂ laminates survive > 7 days continuous flow at 8 bar with < 5 % loss of selectivity. |

These shared motifs illustrate a **unified mechanistic picture**: Li⁺ discrimination is maximised when a pore is just large enough to admit a partially dehydrated Li⁺ ion, while a combination of hard‑acidic coordination and strong negative surface charge repels the larger, more heavily hydrated Na⁺. The synergy of steric confinement, specific binding, and electrostatic exclusion is repeatedly observed across all three branches.

### 2.2 Quantitative Performance Highlights  

| Category | Representative Material/Methodology | Performance Highlights | Key Advantage | Main Limitation |
|----------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Bioinspired peptide‑MXene hybrid** | Ti₃C₂Tx MXene interlayers (6.2 ± 0.1 Å) grafted with AI‑designed Asp‑rich peptides | Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 38; tLi⁺ ≈ 0.77; water permeance ≈ 100 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹; > 95 % flux after 500 h | Stimuli‑responsive gating; scalable roll‑to‑roll click grafting (> 1 m² h⁻¹) | Requires precise peptide synthesis; potential peptide degradation under extreme pH |
| **Lewis‑acidic COF membrane** | Cr³⁺‑oxo‑functionalised β‑ketoenamine COF (4F‑COF/PP) | Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 12 : 1 (10 mM Li⁺, 0.1 MPa); tLi⁺ ≈ 0.68–0.91; > 95 % Li⁺ uptake after 5 cycles | Crystalline order → predictable transport; post‑synthetic tunability | Selectivity drops to ≈ 4 : 1 at 1 MPa/100 mM Li⁺; metal leaching under strong acid |
| **Defect‑engineered GO‑MoS₂ laminate** | GO sheets with vacancy density D/G ≈ 0.4, intercalated 12‑crown‑4, σ ≈ ‑0.10 C m⁻² | γ ≈ 1 400 (single‑salt); > 900 in mixed seawater; flux decline ≤ 32 % after fouling, 85 % recovery | Extremely high selectivity; R2R production (150–300 m² h⁻¹) | Pore‑size uniformity still ±0.2 nm; charge screening in high‑ionic‑strength brines reduces effectiveness without crown‑ether |
| **Hybrid GO‑silica overlayer** | 5 nm SiO₂ coating on peptide‑MXene | Swelling < 6 % in 5 M NaCl; > 95 % Li⁺ flux after 500 h | Mechanical robustness; chemical protection | Additional diffusion resistance modestly lowers permeance |
| **Crown‑ether‑functionalised ZIF‑8/COF composite** | 15‑crown‑5 grafted onto ZIF‑8 nanocrystals embedded in COF matrix | Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 8 : 1; tLi⁺ ≈ 0.55; stable over 200 h | Combines rigid inorganic cage with selective crown | Synthesis complexity; limited scalability reported |

The table demonstrates that **defect‑engineered GO‑MoS₂ laminates currently achieve the highest reported Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity (γ > 1 000)**, albeit under laboratory single‑salt conditions. The peptide‑MXene hybrid offers the best combination of **high selectivity (≈ 38), fast gating, and demonstrated roll‑to‑roll scalability**, making it the most promising candidate for near‑term industrial deployment.

### 2.3 Cross‑Branch Themes  

1. **AI‑assisted design** – Both peptide and COF branches employ generative transformers or high‑throughput DFT/MD pipelines to screen thousands of sequences or functional groups, dramatically shortening experimental cycles (≈ 80 % acceleration).  
2. **Hybrid reinforcement** – Inorganic overlayers (silica, black‑phosphorene) or nanoparticle‑reinforced polymer gels are repeatedly used to curb swelling and mechanical degradation, indicating that pure organic or 2‑D membranes alone are insufficient for long‑term operation.  
3. **Stimuli‑responsive control** – Voltage or pH gating is a unique advantage of peptide‑based systems, but similar electro‑static tuning is also observed in defect‑engineered 2‑D sheets where surface charge can be modulated by external fields.  
4. **Scalability pathways** – All three branches report at least one pilot‑scale fabrication route (roll‑to‑roll vacuum filtration for MXene, continuous interfacial polymerisation for COFs, slot‑die coating + plasma etching for GO). This convergence suggests that the field is moving beyond proof‑of‑concept toward commercial relevance.

## 3. Contradiction Analysis & Resolution  

| Contradiction | Branch(s) Involved | Explanation / Resolution |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Selectivity ceiling of inorganic nano‑confinement** – One claim cites a maximum Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 3.6 (vermiculite), while another reports > 3 900 under light/electric‑field stimulation. | Defect‑engineered 2‑D (statement) vs. hybrid stimulus‑responsive systems (counter‑statement). | The low value (3.6) refers to *static* inorganic layers lacking any functional charge or external field. When a *dynamic* field or light‑induced charge redistribution is applied, the effective energy barrier for Na⁺ rises dramatically, explaining the > 3 000 factor. Both statements are correct within their experimental context. |
| **Effect of surface charge alone** – Some reports claim σ ≈ ‑0.09 C m⁻² suffices for > 10 : 1 selectivity, while others argue charge screening in seawater nullifies this effect. | Defect‑engineered 2‑D (both statements). | The discrepancy stems from ionic strength. In dilute solutions (≤ 0.01 M) the Debye length is > 3 nm, allowing the surface potential to extend into the pore and repel Na⁺. In seawater (I ≈ 0.6 M) the Debye length collapses to < 0.5 nm, so charge alone is insufficient; steric confinement and crown‑ether intercalation become essential. |
| **Stability of peptide nano‑channels** – One view predicts rapid degradation, another shows > 90 % conductance after 500 h. | Bioinspired peptide branch (both statements). | The divergent outcomes are linked to **cross‑link density**. Peptide layers with ≥ 15 % covalent cross‑links retain structure, whereas uncross‑linked peptides hydrolyse quickly. The high‑stability data explicitly mention cross‑linked networks, reconciling the conflict. |
| **Selectivity dependence on pressure in COFs** – Some claim selectivity is pressure‑independent, others provide a log‑linear decay with pressure. | COF branch (both statements). | Early studies measured selectivity at low pressures (< 0.2 MPa) where inter‑layer spacing is rigid, giving the impression of pressure independence. Subsequent high‑pressure experiments (up to 5 MPa) revealed inter‑layer contraction (Δd ≈ 0.02 Å) that reduces Li⁺ affinity, thus the log‑linear relationship is valid only beyond the low‑pressure regime. |
| **Metal leaching from Lewis‑acidic COFs** – One claim of full stability, another of measurable leaching under pH < 2. | COF branch (both statements). | The stability claim applies to **neutral or mildly alkaline** conditions (pH 5–9). Under strongly acidic environments, the metal‑oxo nodes become labile, leading to leaching. Both statements are accurate for their respective pH ranges. |

Overall, the contradictions are **context‑dependent** rather than fundamental disagreements. Recognising the operating envelope (ionic strength, pressure, pH, cross‑linking) resolves each apparent conflict.

## 4. Unique Perspective Insights  

### 4.1 Bioinspired Peptide‑Based Nanochannels  

* **Dual‑lever selectivity** – The combination of sub‑nanometre MXene slits and densely acidic peptide pockets yields Li⁺/Na⁺ separation factors up to **38**, surpassing pure inorganic confinement.  
* **AI‑driven sequence design** – Transformer models generate thousands of candidate peptides, with QM/MD filtering narrowing to ~200 high‑affinity motifs, cutting experimental time by ~80 %.  
* **Stimuli‑responsive gating** – Voltage (±1 V) or pH (5→9) can toggle Li⁺ selectivity within **10 ms**, offering on‑demand control for battery‑separator or extraction applications.  
* **Scalable roll‑to‑roll click grafting** – Demonstrated > 1 m² h⁻¹ throughput with uniform peptide density (CV ≈ 4 %).  
* **Durability strategy** – Thin inorganic overlayers (SiO₂, black‑phosphorene) and nanoparticle‑reinforced gels limit swelling and preserve > 95 % flux after 500 h.  

These insights position peptide‑MXene hybrids as a **technologically mature platform** that bridges molecular selectivity with industrial manufacturability.

### 4.2 Covalent‑Organic‑Framework (COF) Nanochannels  

* **Hard‑acidic Lewis sites** – Cr³⁺‑oxo and Ti⁴⁺ nodes raise Li⁺ binding energy by 0.3–0.5 eV, delivering Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 9–12 under dilute conditions.  
* **Post‑synthetic tunability** – Sequential functionalisation (‑CF₃/‑SO₃H → Li‑alkoxide → transition‑metal) can increase site density to 1.8 mmol g⁻¹, pushing selectivity beyond 12 : 1.  
* **Pressure‑dependent selectivity model** – Empirical log‑linear relationship predicts a drop from 12 : 1 at 0.1 MPa/10 mM Li⁺ to 4 : 1 at 1 MPa/100 mM Li⁺, highlighting the need for mechanical reinforcement at high pressure.  
* **Robustness in aggressive brines** – > 95 % Li⁺ uptake after five regeneration cycles, < 0.05 wt % metal leaching after 200 h in 5 M NaCl/0.5 M HCl.  
* **Energy‑efficient electrodialysis** – Membranes reduce overpotential by ~30 mV, consuming ≈ 0.85 kWh m⁻³ treated water, with fabrication cost ≈ 12 USD m⁻².  

COFs thus provide a **crystalline, chemically tunable scaffold** where selectivity can be rationally engineered, albeit with sensitivity to pressure and pH.

### 4.3 Defect‑Engineered 2D Materials  

* **Vacancy‑driven charged pores** – Raman D/G ≈ 0.3–0.5 (≈ 5 × 10¹³ cm⁻² vacancies) yields surface charge densities of –0.10 C m⁻², essential for electrostatic exclusion.  
* **Crown‑ether intercalation synergy** – 12‑crown‑4 or 15‑crown‑5 lock interlayer spacing at ~0.8 nm, providing a steric filter that works together with negative charge to achieve γ ≈ 1 400–8 400 in single‑salt tests.  
* **Hybrid reinforcement** – GO‑MoS₂ stacks and TiO₂‑MoS₂ composites reach tensile strengths > 30 MPa and pressure tolerance ≥ 8 bar, enabling continuous‑flow operation for > 7 days with < 5 % selectivity loss.  
* **Roll‑to‑roll manufacturing** – Slot‑die coating + plasma etching yields uniform σ (±5 %) across > 10 m‑wide webs at 150–300 m² h⁻¹, with specific energy consumption 0.8–1.2 kWh m⁻².  
* **Fouling resilience** – Flux decline ≤ 32 % in the presence of proteins or humic acids; > 85 % recovery after mild cleaning.  

The defect‑engineered 2‑D approach delivers **unparalleled selectivity** but relies on precise control of vacancy density and supplemental functionalisation to overcome charge screening in high‑ionic‑strength feeds.

## 5. Comprehensive Conclusion  

The comparative analysis of three cutting‑edge research streams reveals that **no single material yet achieves both the absolute highest Li⁺/Na⁺ selectivity and turnkey scalability**, but each contributes essential design knowledge:

1. **Highest reported selectivity** – Defect‑engineered GO‑MoS₂ laminates with crown‑ether intercalation reach **γ > 1 000** in laboratory single‑salt experiments, surpassing the peptide‑MXene (≈ 38) and COF (≈ 12) systems. This demonstrates that **sub‑nanometre charged pores combined with steric crown‑ether gating** can push the selectivity ceiling far beyond traditional inorganic membranes.

2. **Balanced performance and manufacturability** – Peptide‑functionalised MXene membranes deliver **Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 38**, high water permeance, rapid voltage/pH gating, and a proven roll‑to‑roll grafting process. Their durability (≥ 500 h) and modular reinforcement make them the most **industry‑ready** candidate for lithium extraction from brines or as high‑selectivity battery separators.

3. **Rational tunability** – COF nanochannels provide a **crystalline platform** where Lewis‑acidic sites can be systematically varied, enabling predictable adjustments of selectivity, transference number, and chemical stability. Their compatibility with electrodialysis and relatively low fabrication cost (≈ 12 USD m⁻²) make them attractive for **energy‑efficient lithium recovery**.

4. **Key design consensus** – Across all branches, the **triad of sub‑nanometre confinement, hard‑acidic coordination, and negative surface charge** emerges as the fundamental recipe for Li⁺ discrimination. Stimuli‑responsive control (voltage, pH, light) and hybrid reinforcement (inorganic overlayers, nanoparticle gels) are essential for maintaining performance under realistic operating conditions (high ionic strength, pressure, temperature).

5. **Remaining challenges** –  
   * **Pressure‑dependent selectivity** – COFs and peptide‑MXene membranes show reduced Li⁺/Na⁺ ratios at > 1 MPa; engineering interlayer spacers that resist compression is needed.  
   * **Charge screening in seawater** – Defect‑engineered 2‑D membranes lose electrostatic advantage at I ≈ 0.6 M; integrating permanent steric blockers (crown‑ethers) or high‑dielectric interlayers can mitigate this.  
   * **Scale‑up metrics** – Full‑module testing (> 1 m²) for COFs and long‑term (> 10⁴ h) fatigue data for 2‑D laminates remain scarce.  
   * **Economic assessment** – Life‑cycle cost, recycling pathways, and environmental impact of metal‑oxo COFs and peptide synthesis need quantification.

**Answer to the research question:** *The material class that presently exhibits the highest Li⁺ / Na⁺ selectivity in aqueous systems is defect‑engineered, crown‑ether‑intercalated graphene‑oxide/MoS₂ laminates, achieving selectivity factors exceeding 1 000. However, for a pragmatic balance of selectivity, durability, and manufacturability, bioinspired peptide‑grafted MXene membranes (Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 38) and Lewis‑acidic COF nanochannels (Li⁺/Na⁺ ≈ 12) represent the most promising near‑term platforms. Continued integration of AI‑driven design, hybrid reinforcement, and stimuli‑responsive gating is expected to push all three families toward even higher selectivity while meeting industrial scale‑up requirements.*
