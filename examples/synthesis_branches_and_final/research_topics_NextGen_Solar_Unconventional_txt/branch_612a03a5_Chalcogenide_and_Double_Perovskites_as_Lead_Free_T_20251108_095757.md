# Branch Synthesis: Chalcogenide and Double Perovskites as Lead‑Free Tandem Absorbers\n## Branch ID: 612a03a5e5825aeb\n## Depth: 3\n\n**A. Consolidated Insights (≈6 bullets)**  

- **Band‑gap tunability & efficiency ceiling:** Ti‑rich/Se‑rich CaHfS₃ alloys can be tuned from **1.29 eV to 2.67 eV** (direct gaps) and exhibit a spectroscopic‑limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of **≈ 28 %**; when paired with lead‑free double‑perovskites (e.g., Cs₄CuSb₂Cl₁₂) simulated tandem PCEs reach **34.7 %–36.9 %** (V_oc ≈ 1.8–2.2 V, FF ≈ 80–88 %).  

- **Carrier transport:** Ti‑rich CaHfS₃ alloys achieve **polaron mobilities > 30 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹** and exciton binding energies **< 30 meV**, while SPS‑processed CaHfS₃ shows **electron mobility ≈ 16.8 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹** and **hole mobility ≈ 2.6 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹**, meeting the > 10 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹ benchmark for high‑current tandem top cells.  

- **Low‑temperature processing:** Phase‑pure BaZrS₃ films have been produced at **≤ 500 °C** via a two‑step solution route; molecular‑ink and colloidal routes for BaZrS₃ and related chalcogenides have demonstrated nucleation at **≈ 330 °C** and film formation at **≈ 200 °C**, moving the thermal budget toward the **≤ 150 °C** target needed for flexible substrates.  

- **Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) integration:** Solution‑processed ZnO or SnO₂ nanocrystal inks (annealed **120–150 °C**) and plasma‑enhanced ALD Al‑doped ZnO (AZO) (plasma ≤ 50 W, substrate ≤ 80 °C) both achieve **sheet resistance < 10 Ω sq⁻¹** with **> 85 % NIR transmittance**; a thin (< 1 nm) Al₂O₃ seed layer further suppresses interfacial oxidation.  

- **Interface passivation:** Selenophene‑based thiol molecules form < 1 nm interfacial layers that survive **85 °C/85 % RH illumination for > 1000 h**, reducing interfacial recombination and delivering **≈ 50 mV V_oc gain** in halide perovskites; analogous passivation for chalcogenide/double‑perovskite stacks is projected to give similar benefits.  

- **Stability & scalability:** BaZrS₃ films exhibit no measurable degradation after **> 500 h** at 85 °C in air; MXene‑protected interfaces retain **> 95 %** of initial PCE after **1250 h** open‑air exposure, indicating that robust, low‑temperature TCOs and passivation layers can meet IEC‑type durability requirements for lead‑free tandems.

**B. Divergent Claims (statement vs. counter‑statement)**  

- **Claim:** “Low‑temperature (≤ 150 °C) synthesis of phase‑pure BaZrS₃ or CaHfS₃ is already demonstrated.”  
  **Counter‑statement:** “All reported routes still require a crystallization step ≥ 300 °C (e.g., 330 °C colloidal nucleation, 500 °C solution anneal); true ≤ 150 °C phase‑pure films have not yet been reported.”  

- **Claim:** “Al‑doped ZnO (AZO) deposited at ≤ 150 °C provides contact resistivity < 5 mΩ·cm² and sheet resistance ≈ 10 Ω sq⁻¹, fully compatible with high‑efficiency tandems.”  
  **Counter‑statement:** “While AZO meets the sheet‑resistance target, the bulk resistivity minimum (≈ 2.2 × 10⁻² Ω·cm at 1 % Al) and the need for an additional IZO/ITO barrier to prevent chemical attack suggest that further optimization is required before full compatibility is proven.”  

- **Claim:** “Selenophene‑thiol passivation will automatically translate to chalcogenide/double‑perovskite interfaces, delivering > 50 mV V_oc improvement.”  
  **Counter‑statement:** “No experimental data exist for thiol passivation on chalcogenide/double‑perovskite stacks; the claim remains speculative until interfacial chemistry and binding‑energy studies are completed.”

**C. Notable Gaps (~3 bullets)**  

- **Absence of experimentally verified monolithic lead‑free tandems > 20 % PCE** – all > 30 % efficiencies are simulation‑only; no full device has been fabricated and tested.  
- **Lack of quantitative band‑alignment and defect‑density maps** linking Ti/Se composition in CaHfS₃ (or BaZrS₃) to carrier lifetime, SRH recombination, and optimal current‑matching with double‑perovskite top cells.  
- **No demonstrated ≤ 150 °C crystallization of chalcogenide perovskites** and no systematic study of O₂‑plasma‑induced S²⁻ oxidation during low‑temperature ALD of ZnO/AZO on sulfide surfaces.

**D. Confidence**  
**Medium** – the synthesis draws on multiple quantitative reports, but several critical experimental validations (≤ 150 °C chalcogenide crystallization, real‑device tandem performance, and interfacial passivation on sulfide surfaces) are still missing.
