# Branch Synthesis: Defining ‘True Cleanup’: Integrated Toxicological Benchmarks and Analytical Fingerprints for Mineralisation Assessment\n## Branch ID: 9202eacc29e07ea7\n## Depth: 3\n\n**A. Consolidated Insights**  

- **True‑cleanup definition converges on three quantitative pillars:** (i) ≥ 85–90 % total organic carbon (TOC) removal (≥ 95 % carbon‑mass‑balance when all fingerprinted products are accounted for), (ii) residual toxicity ≤ 10 % of the control EC₅₀ (or ≤ 10 % of the control value in Tier‑2 bioassays), and (iii) metal leaching from heterogeneous catalysts ≤ 0.2 mg L⁻¹ for Fe, ≤ 2 mg L⁻¹ for Cu and ≤ 0.1 mg L⁻¹ for Ce – all far below drinking‑water limits.  
- **Photothermal‑Fenton/LED‑driven AOPs and visible‑light Fe‑MOF/Fe‑PILC catalysts consistently achieve ≥ 95 % mineralisation of model polymers (PS, PE, PP, PET) within 30–120 min, while maintaining catalyst activity over ≥ 10 reuse cycles with ≤ 3 % activity loss.**  
- **Hybrid catalytic‑biological routes (PETase‑expressing *Pseudomonas* + TiO₂ or Cu‑Fe@γ‑Al₂O₃) provide simultaneous polymer depolymerisation to monomers (≥ 90 % yield) and downstream mineralisation, linking carbon‑recovery to toxicity mitigation.**  
- **Real‑time analytical fingerprints (FTIR‑ATR/Raman, QCM, magnetoelastic sensors, AI‑driven imaging, LC‑HRMS, ICP‑MS) enable closed‑loop process control; •OH concentrations ≥ 10⁻⁸ M are verified by fluorescence, EPR and graphene‑FET probes, keeping intermediate concentrations below the 10 % toxicity threshold.**  
- **Life‑cycle assessment (LCA) shows that solar/LED‑driven photothermal‑Fenton systems have a global‑warming potential ≤ 0.15 kg CO₂‑eq m⁻³ (≈ 70 % lower than incineration) and eutrophication potential ≤ 0.008 kg PO₄‑eq m⁻³, meeting the absolute impact metrics required for “true cleanup.”**  
- **Standardisation is emerging through the Mineralisation Assessment Protocol (MAP) and Benchmark‑Dose (BMD) toxicological modelling, which together provide a reproducible, regulator‑ready framework for reporting MP‑TEQ (microplastic‑toxic‑equivalent) values across polymer types.**

**B. Divergent Claims**  

- **Claim:** *Photothermal‑Fenton hybrids achieve ≈ 100 % degradation of 310 nm PS spheres in 4 h without external H₂O₂.*  
  **Counter‑statement:** *Other studies report that visible‑light TiO₂ alone requires external H₂O₂ or higher temperatures (> 120 °C) to reach comparable removal, suggesting the peroxide‑free claim may be system‑specific.*  

- **Claim:** *Cu‑Fe@γ‑Al₂O₃ microspheres retain > 97 % activity after 10 cycles with metal leaching ≤ 2 ppm.*  
  **Counter‑statement:** *Magnetoelastic sensor data indicate a wave‑like Fe release at low pH that can temporarily exceed 2 ppm, raising concerns about consistency across pH regimes.*  

- **Claim:** *LED‑driven photothermal‑Fenton reactors consume ≤ 0.5 kWh m⁻³, delivering a GWP of 0.15 kg CO₂‑eq m⁻³.*  
  **Counter‑statement:** *Microwave‑assisted Fenton studies report higher electricity demand (≈ 0.9 kWh m⁻³) but achieve faster kinetics, suggesting a trade‑off between energy intensity and reaction time that is not fully resolved.*  

- **Claim:** *Hybrid enzymatic‑catalytic systems (PETase + TiO₂) achieve ≥ 90 % monomer yield and > 99 % TOC removal.*  
  **Counter‑statement:** *Enzyme deactivation under UV illumination can drop PETase activity by > 30 % after 2 h, potentially limiting the simultaneous high‑yield depolymerisation claim.*  

- **Claim:** *Real‑time QCM spikes trigger microfluidic bioassays within 5 min, guaranteeing toxicity control.*  
  **Counter‑statement:** *Latency in sensor‑to‑bioassay communication (reported up to 15 min in some setups) may allow transient toxic intermediates to accumulate, questioning the immediacy of the control loop.*  

- **Claim:** *Metal‑free carbon nanodots remain structurally intact for > 1 000 h with < 5 % activity loss.*  
  **Counter‑statement:** *Long‑term stability tests (> 500 h) under high ionic strength (0.3 M NaCl) show a gradual decline in fluorescence quantum yield, indicating possible degradation in realistic water matrices.*

**C. Notable Gaps**  

- **Long‑term (> 20 cycles) catalyst durability and leaching behavior in real‑world matrices (high ionic strength, natural organic matter, variable pH) remain unquantified.**  
- **Comprehensive chronic toxicology (e.g., zebrafish developmental, mammalian endocrine disruption) for the full suite of degradation intermediates is missing; most studies stop at acute Daphnia or cell‑based ROS assays.**  
- **Economic and full‑scale life‑cycle analyses (CAPEX, OPEX, catalyst synthesis footprint) are still limited to laboratory‑scale estimates; cost per m³ treated and scalability to municipal‑scale flows (> 10 m³ day⁻¹) need robust data.**
