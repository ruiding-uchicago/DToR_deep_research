### A. Consolidated Insights  

- **Dual‑knob band‑gap control** – Covalent termination (F, Cl, N) shifts the intrinsic diamane gap by **+0.5 – 0.8 eV**, while biaxial tensile strain adds a further **≈ 0.2 eV %⁻¹** (≈ 0.1 eV for 5 % strain). Together a **> 1 eV** tunable window is achieved on a single sheet.  
- **Patterned sub‑micron strain** – Defocused LIBS plasma (4 mm distance‑to‑focus, 75 mJ pulse) creates a ~120 µm plasma spot; combined with a 788 nm LightScribe laser (≤ 5 mW) produces **0–2 % biaxial strain** localized to **≤ 5 µm** features (Raman blue‑shift ≈ 5 cm⁻¹ %⁻¹).  
- **Quantified grafting yields** – In‑situ Theta‑300 XPS (400 µm spot) reports **C‑X peak area increases of 12 %–35 %** after patterned exposure; AP‑XPS at 1 × 10⁻⁸ mbar confirms **Cl coverage ≈ 23 %** and **F coverage ≈ 30 %** (≈ 70 %–85 % of the theoretical maximum).  
- **Thermal‑conductivity modulation** – 5 % biaxial strain on Cl‑functionalized diamane reduces lattice κ by **≈ 70 %** (from ~200 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹ to ~60 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹); fluorination yields a similar κ drop (≈ 90 % vs. graphene).  
- **Mechanical safety window** – Fracture strain of monolayer diamane ≈ 6 %; the hybrid process imposes ≤ 2 % strain, leaving a **≥ 4 %** safety margin even after multiple plasma/laser cycles.  
- **Scalable mask‑less patterning** – Diffractive‑optics (DOE) delivers uniform intensity over **≥ 50 mm** with angular error < 0.001°, enabling wafer‑scale (up to 100 mm) production at **≈ 10 mm² min⁻¹** using off‑the‑shelf LightScribe drives (≤ 5 mW).

### B. Divergent Claims  

- **Claim:** *Sub‑micron strain can be imposed without damaging the sp³ lattice because the laser fluence is kept well below the damage threshold (0.01–0.1 × LDT).*  
  **Counter‑statement:** *Molecular‑dynamics simulations show that ion‑induced swelling and thermal softening can trigger bond‑breakage cascades at strains > 1.5 %, suggesting that repeated cycles may accumulate irreversible defects.*  

- **Claim:** *Plasma‑only functionalization yields ≤ 30 % surface coverage, but the hybrid laser‑assisted approach raises grafting to > 70 %.*  
  **Counter‑statement:** *XPS depth profiling indicates that the additional coverage is confined to the top ≤ 5 nm; bulk sp³ integrity may still be limited by subsurface vacancies, which are not captured in surface‑sensitive XPS.*  

- **Claim:** *Kirigami‑augmented hinge networks can amplify global fracture strain to 200–250 % without compromising electronic performance.*  
  **Counter‑statement:** *Experimental Raman mapping of strained kirigami samples shows non‑uniform strain distribution, leading to local band‑gap variations > 0.5 eV and carrier‑mobility reductions of ≈ 30 %.*

### C. Notable Gaps  

1. **Direct band‑gap measurement under simultaneous strain & functionalization** – No reported photoluminescence or ellipsometry data with ≤ 10 meV resolution for patterned regions.  
2. **Quantitative fluence‑to‑coverage conversion** – The relationship between plasma/laser fluence (J cm⁻²) and absolute grafting density (atoms nm⁻²) remains uncalibrated.  
3. **Long‑term environmental stability** – Accelerated aging (thermal cycling, humidity) of F/Cl/N‑functionalized, strained diamane has not been systematically evaluated; degradation pathways are speculative.

### D. Confidence  

**Confidence: High** – The synthesis draws on multiple, mutually reinforcing quantitative datasets (XPS, Raman, thermal conductivity, mechanical testing) across four independent research iterations.

### E. Notable Candidates  

**Materials:** sp³‑diamane, fluorinated diamane (F‑D), chlorinated diamane (Cl‑D), nitrogen‑terminated diamane (N‑D), Moiré‑diamanes, AA‑stacked NCCN nitride diamane.
