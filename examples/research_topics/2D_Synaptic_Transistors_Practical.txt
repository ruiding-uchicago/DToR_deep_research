Which two-dimensional material platforms (e.g., MoS₂, WSe₂, black phosphorus, h-BN), device architectures (e.g., floating-gate, ionic-gated, dual-gate), and fabrication protocols (e.g., channel thickness control, dielectric engineering, contact metallurgy) have been shown to optimize synaptic transistor performance—specifically in terms of energy per event, weight-update linearity, retention time, and cycling endurance—for neuromorphic sensing applications? Think of most practical and promising candidates.
