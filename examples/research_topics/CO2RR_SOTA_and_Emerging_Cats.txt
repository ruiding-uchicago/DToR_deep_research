Given the current landscape of CO₂ electroreduction, which state-of-the-art catalyst platforms—such as oxide-derived copper, single-atom catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon supports, or metal–organic framework-derived materials—demonstrate the highest activity and selectivity? Moreover, what emerging catalytic systems or novel heterostructures beyond these examples could feasibly outperform today's leading electrocatalysts in terms of faradaic efficiency and stability?
