Which membrane materials can effectively separate Li⁺, Co²⁺, and Ni²⁺ ions from aqueous solutions by leveraging selective transport properties—such as tailored pore sizes, specific surface functionalizations, and charge affinities—and what membrane design principles optimize both selectivity and permeability? Think of potential novel, effective, and practical candidates.
