Which printed‐electronics fabrication parameters and post‐processing strategies—such as ink viscosity, printing speed and resolution, substrate surface energy, annealing temperature profiles, and in‐line calibration methods—have been shown to minimize device‐to‐device variability in FET sensor arrays, and what specific process windows achieve low variation in threshold voltage and field‐effect mobility?
