Which two-dimensional materials—such as graphene derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides, or MXenes—offer the highest CO₂ sensing performance in complex gas or aqueous environments, and how do they compare in terms of detection limit (ppm), selectivity against common interferents (e.g., O₂, H₂O), response/recovery time, and long-term stability, including any functionalization or structural modifications that enhance these metrics? Think of novel candidates.
