Which nanostructured electrocatalyst materials demonstrate the highest selectivity and efficiency for electrochemical detection and recovery of critical resources (e.g., Li⁺, PO₄³⁻, NH₄⁺) from complex wastewater matrices, and what key performance metrics—such as selectivity, sensitivity, recovery rate, energy consumption, and operational stability—distinguish them?
