Search for novel fluorinated ether–based electrolyte candidates that incorporate covalently bound anion-receptor motifs (e.g. boron- or phosphorus-centered groups) to deliver oxidative stability beyond 5.6 V, Li⁺ transference numbers above 0.8, and minimal interfacial impedance on lithium-metal anodes.
