Which commercially available, cost-effective probe chemistries (e.g., thiolated DNA aptamers, antibody mimetics, conductive MIPs) combined with two-dimensional nanomaterial transducer platforms (e.g., WS₂ FETs, graphene field-effect sensors, nanotube-extended gate FETs) deliver the lowest detection limits, minimal batch variability, and robust performance for sensing trace levels of pharmaceutical antibiotics in diverse aqueous waterbody.
