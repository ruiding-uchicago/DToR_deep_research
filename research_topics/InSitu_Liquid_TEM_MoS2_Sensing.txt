How can in situ liquid cell TEM be employed to directly visualize the real-time adsorption and structural changes of 2D MoS₂ nanosheets used in aqueous FET sensors during analyte binding? What fluid cell configurations and electron dose parameters are necessary to preserve native water–material interfaces while capturing high-resolution sensing events without beam-induced artifacts?
