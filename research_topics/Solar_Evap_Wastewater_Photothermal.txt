What photothermal materials and system designs are most effective for solar-driven water evaporation in complex wastewater matrices—such as high-organic-load or multi-ion streams—and how do they compare in terms of material composition, solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency under one-sun illumination, evaporation rate, fouling resistance, and integrated resource-recovery functionalities?
