Which two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials or molecular probes—including novel, underexplored candidates—offer the greatest potential to achieve highly sensitive and selective detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), or more broadly chemical and biological analytes, when integrated into a field-effect transistor (FET)–based sensor platform?
