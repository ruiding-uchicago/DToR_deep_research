Which two-dimensional material platforms (e.g., graphene derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes), molecular recognition elements (e.g., molecularly imprinted polymers, aptamers, peptide receptors), and device integration strategies (e.g., FET, electrochemical impedance, photonic transduction) have demonstrated the highest sensitivity, selectivity against organic matter and ionic interferents, and rapid response times for detecting micro- and nanoplastic particles in complex water matrices? Think of novel candidates.
