Identify the top nanostructured electrocatalyst materials for driving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in complex wastewater matrices—such as high‐chloride, high‐organic‐load, or multi‐ion streams—,  for each the material class/composition, comprehensively consider key performance metrics (overpotential at 10 mA cm⁻², Faradaic efficiency, stability), and the surface‐engineering strategies that confer corrosion resistance and sustained activity in real effluent conditions.
