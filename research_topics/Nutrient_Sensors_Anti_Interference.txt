Which sensor probe materials/chemicals and designs offer the best performance in minimizing interference factors—such as competing ions, dissolved organic matter, pH fluctuations, and temperature variations—for accurate and selective detection of nutrients (e.g., nitrate, phosphate, ammonium) in complex water matrices, and what mitigation strategies do they employ?
