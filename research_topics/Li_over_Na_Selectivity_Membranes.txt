What material or membrane exhibits the highest selectivity for Li⁺ over Na⁺ in aqueous systems, given their nearly identical hydrated ionic radii and solvation environments? Beyond crown-ether–functionalized polymers, what novel or unexpected materials—such as bioinspired ultrahigh-selectivity membranes or covalent organic framework nanochannels—might provide breakthrough Li⁺ discrimination over Na⁺? Find novel and promising candidates.
